<p>AI agents are reshaping software development, from writing code to carrying out complex instructions. Yet LLM-based agents are prone to errors and often perform poorly on complicated, multi-step tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an approach where AI systems learn to make optimal decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions, improving through trial and error. RL can help agents improve, but it typically requires developers to extensively rewrite their code. This discourages adoption, even though the data these agents generate could significantly boost performance through RL training.</p>



<p>To address this, a research team from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msr-asia-shanghai/">Microsoft Research Asia &#8211; Shanghai</a> has introduced <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/agent-lightning/">Agent Lightning</a>. This <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning">open-source<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> framework makes AI agents trainable through RL by separating how agents execute tasks from model training, allowing developers to add RL capabilities with virtually no code modification.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="capturing-agent-behavior-for-training">Capturing agent behavior for training</h2>



<p>Agent Lightning converts an agent&#8217;s experience into a format that RL can use by treating the agent&#8217;s execution as a sequence of states and actions, where each state captures the agent&#8217;s status and each LLM call is an action that moves the agent to a new state.</p>



<p>This approach works for any workflow, no matter how complex. Whether it involves multiple collaborating agents or dynamic tool use, Agent Lightning breaks it down into a sequence of transitions. Each transition captures the LLM’s input, output, and reward (Figure 1). This standardized format means the data can be used for training without any&nbsp;additional&nbsp;steps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="891" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Diagram illustrating Agent Lightning’s unified data interface for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent. On the left, four states (state₀ to state₃) show the agent’s execution flow, where semantic variables—UserInput, Query, Passages, and Answer—are updated after each component call (LLM or Search). Green blocks represent populated variables; gray blocks indicate empty ones. On the right, the unified data interface converts these transitions into a trajectory format containing prompt, generation, and immediate reward for RL training. " class="wp-image-1158102" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-300x104.jpg 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-1024x356.jpg 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-768x267.jpg 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-1536x534.jpg 1536w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-2048x713.jpg 2048w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-1-240x84.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1. An illustration of Agent Lightning’s standardized format using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent. Left: The full agent workflow, where the agent&#8217;s state updates after each component step. The green blocks show assigned variables, and the gray blocks indicate variables without content. Right: The collected transitions are based on the standardized format for the RL training process, with each transition corresponding to one LLM step that contains its prompt, result, and immediate reward.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hierarchical-reinforcement-learning">Hierarchical reinforcement learning</h2>



<p>Traditional RL training for agents that make multiple LLM requests involves stitching together all content into one long sequence and then identifying which parts should be learned and which ignored during training. This approach is difficult to implement and can create excessively long sequences that degrade model performance.</p>



<p>Instead, Agent Lightning’s LightningRL algorithm takes a hierarchical approach. After a task completes, a credit assignment module determines how much each LLM request contributed to the outcome and assigns it a corresponding reward. These independent steps, now paired with their own reward scores, can be used with any existing single-step RL algorithm, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Figure 2).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="835" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-scaled.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Comparison of three reinforcement learning approaches for LLM tasks. (a) Single-step GRPO: The model completes the task in one call, and multiple outputs for the same task are compared with associated rewards. (b) Previous multi-step GRPO: The task spans multiple LLM calls, forming trajectories; non-LLM tokens (gray boxes) are ignored during training, and entire multi-step runs are compared. (c) LightningRL: Breaks multi-step runs into individual LLM calls, each including input, context, output, and reward assigned by a credit assignment module. Calls from the same task are grouped for reinforcement. " class="wp-image-1158259" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-300x98.jpg 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-1024x334.jpg 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-768x250.jpg 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-1536x501.jpg 1536w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-2048x668.jpg 2048w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-2-new-240x78.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2. (a) Single-step GRPO: The LLM completes the task in one call. Multiple responses for the same task are compared to determine how strongly each should be reinforced. (b) Previous multi-step GRPO: The task involves multiple LLM calls. Multiple multi-step runs of the same task are compared, with non-LLM generated tokens (grey boxes) ignored during training. (c) LightningRL: The multi-step run is divided into individual LLM calls. Calls from the same task are compared to determine how strongly each should be reinforced. Each call includes its input, context, output, and reward, assigned by the credit assignment module.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This design offers several benefits. It remains fully compatible with widely used single-step RL algorithms, allowing existing training methods to be applied without modification. Organizing data as a sequence of independent transitions lets developers flexibly construct the LLM input as needed, supporting complex behaviors like agents that use multiple tools or&nbsp;work&nbsp;with other agents. Additionally, by keeping sequences short, the approach scales cleanly and keeps training efficient.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="agent-lightning-as-middleware">Agent Lightning as middleware</h2>



<p>Agent Lightning serves as middleware between RL algorithms and agent environments, providing modular components that enable scalable RL through standardized protocols and well-defined interfaces.</p>



<p>An <strong>agent runner</strong> manages the agents as they complete tasks. It distributes work and collects and stores the results and progress data. It operates separately from the LLMs, enabling them to run on different resources and scale to support multiple agents running concurrently.</p>



<p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> trains the models and hosts the LLMs used for inference and training. It orchestrates the overall RL cycle, managing which tasks are assigned, how agents complete them, and how models are updated based on what the agents learn. It typically runs on GPU resources and communicates with the agent runner through shared protocols.</p>



<p>The <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/latest/how-to/write-first-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LightningStore<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> serves as the central repository for all data exchanges within the system. It provides standardized interfaces and a shared format, ensuring that the different components can work together and enabling the algorithm and agent runner to communicate effectively.</p>

The Agent Lightning framework</figcaption></figure>



<p>All RL cycles follow two steps: (1) Agent Lightning collects agent execution data (called “spans”) and store them in the data store; (2) it then retrieves the required data and sends it to the algorithm for training. Through this design, the algorithm can delegate tasks asynchronously to the agent runner, which completes them and reports the results back (Figure 4).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2347" height="840" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/figure-4-new.png" alt="Figure 4: Diagram of the training loop in Agent Lightning.

Agent Lightning’s RL cycle</figcaption></figure>



<p>One key advantage of this approach is its algorithmic flexibility. The system makes it easy for developers to customize how agents learn, whether they&#8217;re defining different rewards, capturing intermediate data, or experimenting with different training approaches.</p>



<p>Another advantage is resource efficiency. Agentic RL systems are complex, integrating agentic systems, LLM inference engines, and training frameworks. By separating these components, Agent Lightning makes this complexity manageable and allows each part to be optimized independently</p>



<p>A decoupled design allows each component to use the hardware that suits it best. The agent runner can use CPUs while model training uses GPUs. Each component can also scale independently, improving efficiency and making the system easier to maintain. In practice, developers can keep their existing agent frameworks and switch model calls to the Agent Lightning API without changing their agent code (Figure 5). </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluation-across-three-real-world-scenarios">Evaluation across three real-world scenarios</h2>



<p>Agent Lightning was tested on three distinct tasks, achieving consistent performance improvements across all scenarios (Figure 6):</p>



<p><strong>Text-to-SQL (LangChain):</strong> In a system with three agents handling SQL generation, checking, and rewriting, Agent Lightning simultaneously optimized two of them, significantly improving the accuracy of generating executable SQL from natural language queries.</p>



<p><strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (OpenAI Agents SDK implementation):</strong> On the multi-hop question-answering dataset MuSiQue, which requires querying a large Wikipedia database, Agent Lightning helped the agent generate more effective search queries and reason better from retrieved content.</p>



<p><strong>Mathematical QA and tool use (AutoGen implementation):</strong> For complex math problems, Agent Lightning trained LLMs to more accurately determine when and how to call the tool and integrate the results into its reasoning, increasing accuracy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enabling-continuous-agent-improvement">Enabling continuous agent improvement</h2>



<p>By simplifying RL integration, Agent Lightning can make it easier for developers to build, iterate, and deploy high-performance agents. We plan to expand Agent Lightning&#8217;s capabilities to include automatic prompt optimization and additional RL algorithms.</p>



<p>The framework is designed to serve as an open platform where any AI agent can improve through real-world practice. By bridging existing agentic&nbsp;systems with reinforcement learning, Agent Lightning aims to help create AI systems that learn from experience and improve over time.</p>

<p>Anyone who uses AI systems knows the frustration: a prompt is given, the response misses the mark, and the cycle repeats. This trial-and-error loop can feel unpredictable and discouraging. To address this, we are excited to introduce <strong>Promptions</strong> (<em>prompt + options</em>), a UI framework that helps developers build AI interfaces with more precise user control.</p>



<p>Its simple design makes it easy to integrate into any setting&nbsp;that relies on added context, including customer support, education, and medicine. Promptions is available under the MIT license on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://labs.ai.azure.com/projects/promptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Foundry Labs<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and GitHub.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background">Background</h2>



<p>Promptions&nbsp;builds on&nbsp;our research,&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/dynamic-prompt-middleware-contextual-prompt-refinement-controls-for-comprehension-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynamic Prompt Middleware: Contextual Prompt Refinement Controls for Comprehension Tasks</a>.”&nbsp;This&nbsp;project&nbsp;examined&nbsp;how&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;workers&nbsp;use&nbsp;generative AI when their goal is&nbsp;to <em>understand</em> rather than&nbsp;<em>create</em>. While much public&nbsp;discussion centers on&nbsp;AI producing text&nbsp;or&nbsp;images, understanding involves asking AI to explain, clarify, or teach—a&nbsp;task&nbsp;that can&nbsp;quickly become&nbsp;complex. Consider a spreadsheet formula: one&nbsp;user may want a&nbsp;simple syntax&nbsp;breakdown,&nbsp;another a&nbsp;debugging&nbsp;guide, and&nbsp;another an explanation suitable for&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;colleagues.&nbsp;The same formula can require&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;different explanations depending on the user’s role, expertise, and goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A great deal of complexity sits beneath these&nbsp;seemingly simple&nbsp;requests.&nbsp;Users&nbsp;often&nbsp;find&nbsp;that the way&nbsp;they phrase a question&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;match&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/what-is-it-like-to-program-with-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level of detail the AI&nbsp;needs</a>.&nbsp;Clarifying what they really want can require long, carefully worded&nbsp;prompts that are tiring to produce.&nbsp;And because the connection&nbsp;between natural language and system behavior&nbsp;isn’t always transparent, it can be difficult to predict&nbsp;how the AI will interpret a&nbsp;given&nbsp;request.&nbsp;In the end, users spend more time&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-metacognitive-demands-and-opportunities-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing the interaction itself</a>&nbsp;than understanding the material they&nbsp;hoped&nbsp;to learn.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identifying-how-users-want-to-guide-ai-outputs">Identifying&nbsp;how users want to guide AI outputs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To explore why these challenges persist and how people can better steer AI toward customized results, we conducted two studies with knowledge workers across technical and nontechnical roles. Their experiences highlighted important gaps that guided Promptions&#8217; design.</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;first study&nbsp;involved&nbsp;38 professionals&nbsp;across&nbsp;engineering, research, marketing, and program management. Participants reviewed&nbsp;design mock-ups that&nbsp;provided&nbsp;static&nbsp;prompt-refinement&nbsp;options—such as&nbsp;<em>length</em>, <em>tone</em>, or <em>start with</em>—for shaping&nbsp;AI&nbsp;responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although these&nbsp;static&nbsp;options were helpful, they&nbsp;couldn’t&nbsp;adapt to the&nbsp;specific formula, code snippets, or text&nbsp;the participant&nbsp;was trying to understand.&nbsp;Participants&nbsp;also wanted direct ways to&nbsp;customize&nbsp;the&nbsp;tone,&nbsp;detail, or&nbsp;format of the response&nbsp;without&nbsp;having to&nbsp;type instructions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-dynamic-refinement-matters">Why dynamic refinement matters</h3>



<p>The&nbsp;second study&nbsp;tested&nbsp;prototypes&nbsp;in a&nbsp;controlled experiment.&nbsp;We compared the static&nbsp;design&nbsp;from the first study, called&nbsp;the&nbsp;“Static Prompt Refinement Control”&nbsp;(Static PRC),&nbsp;against a&nbsp;“Dynamic Prompt Refinement Control” (Dynamic PRC)&nbsp;with features that&nbsp;responded&nbsp;to&nbsp;participants’ feedback.&nbsp;Sixteen&nbsp;technical&nbsp;professionals familiar with generative AI&nbsp;completed six tasks,&nbsp;spanning&nbsp;code explanation,&nbsp;understanding a&nbsp;complex topic, and&nbsp;learning a new&nbsp;skill.&nbsp;Each participant tested both systems, with task assignments balanced to ensure fair comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparing Dynamic PRC to Static PRC revealed key insights into how dynamic prompt-refinement options change users’ sense of control and exploration and how those options help them reflect on their understanding. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="static-prompt-refinement">Static&nbsp;prompt&nbsp;refinement</h3>



<p>Static PRC&nbsp;offered a set of pre‑selected controls&nbsp;(Figure 1)&nbsp;identified&nbsp;in the&nbsp;initial&nbsp;study.&nbsp;We expected these options to be useful&nbsp;across many&nbsp;types of&nbsp;explanation-seeking&nbsp;prompts.</p>

<p>We built the Dynamic PRC system to automatically produce prompt options and refinements based on the user’s input, presenting them in real time so that users could adjust these controls and guide the AI’s responses more precisely (Figure 2).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="findings">Findings</h2>



<p>Participants consistently reported that dynamic controls made it easier to express the nuances of their tasks without repeatedly rephrasing their prompts. This reduced the effort of prompt engineering and allowed users to focus more on understanding content than managing the mechanics of phrasing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="627" height="313" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig04-plotpreferences-1.png" alt="Alt text: Box plot chart titled “Dynamic vs Static PRC: Which tool…”, comparing user responses to six questions about preference, mental demand, feeling rushed, success, effort, and annoyance. Y-axis ranges from 1 (Dynamic) to 7 (Static), with 4 marked as Equal. Each question is represented by a box plot showing response distribution, median, and variability, illustrating perceived differences between dynamic and static PRC tools." class="wp-image-1157879" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig04-plotpreferences-1.png 627w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig04-plotpreferences-1-300x150.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig04-plotpreferences-1-240x120.png 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Comparison of&nbsp;user&nbsp;preferences for Static&nbsp;PRC&nbsp;versus&nbsp;Dynamic PRC&nbsp;across key evaluation criteria.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Contextual options prompted users to try refinements they might not have considered on their own. This behavior suggests that Dynamic PRC can broaden how users engage with AI explanations, helping them uncover new ways to approach tasks beyond their initial intent. Beyond exploration, the dynamic controls prompted participants to think more deliberately about their goals. Options like &#8220;Learning Objective&#8221; and &#8220;Response Format&#8221; helped them clarify what they needed, whether guidance on applying a concept or step-by-step troubleshooting help.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="627" height="358" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig05-ploteffectiveness-1.png" alt="Alt text: Box plot chart titled “Dynamic vs Static PRC: Control Effectiveness,” comparing user agreement with four statements about AI control tools.

<p>While participants valued Dynamic PRC’s adaptability, they also found it more difficult to interpret. Some struggled to anticipate how a selected option would influence the response, noting that the controls seemed opaque because the effect became clear only after the output appeared.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;overall&nbsp;positive response&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dynamic PRC&nbsp;showed us that Promptions&nbsp;could&nbsp;be&nbsp;broadly useful,&nbsp;leading&nbsp;us to share it&nbsp;with the developer community.   &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-design">Technical design</h3>



<p>Promptions works as a lightweight middleware layer that sits between the user and the underlying language model (Figure 5). It has two main components:</p>



<p><strong>Option Module</strong>. This module reviews the user’s prompt and conversation history, then generates a set of refinement options. These are presented as interactive UI elements (radio buttons, checkboxes, text fields) that directly shape how the AI interprets the prompt.</p>



<p><strong>Chat&nbsp;Module.</strong>&nbsp;This module&nbsp;produces the&nbsp;AI’s response based&nbsp;on the refined prompt.&nbsp;When&nbsp;a user changes an option,&nbsp;the&nbsp;response&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;updates,&nbsp;making the interaction feel more like an&nbsp;evolving&nbsp;conversation&nbsp;than&nbsp;a cycle of&nbsp;repeated prompts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="524" height="547" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig07-systemflow-1.png" alt="Alt text: The Promptions system model. (1) The Option Module ingests the user’s prompt input along with the conversation history. (2) It then outputs a set of prompt options, each initialized based on the content of the prompt. (3) These options are rendered inline via a dedicated rendering engine. (4) The Chat Module incorporates the refined options as grounding, alongside the original prompt and conversation history, to generate a chat response. (5) The user can modify the GUI controls, which updates the refinements and triggers the Chat Module to regenerate the current response accordingly." class="wp-image-1157886" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig07-systemflow-1.png 524w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig07-systemflow-1-287x300.png 287w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig07-systemflow-1-172x180.png 172w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Promptions&nbsp;middleware workflow.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adding-promptions-to-an-application">Adding Promptions to an application</h3>



<p>Promptions easily integrates into any conversational chat interface. Developers only need to add a component to display the options and connect it to the AI system. There&#8217;s no need to store date between sessions, which keeps implementation simple. The <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://labs.ai.azure.com/projects/promptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Foundry Labs<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> repository includes two sample applications, a generic chatbot and an image generator, that demonstrate this design in practice.  </p>



<p>Promptions is well-suited for interfaces where users need to provide context but don’t want to write it all out. Instead of typing lengthy explanations, they can adjust the controls that guide the AI’s response to match their preferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-for-further-exploration">Questions for further exploration</h2>



<p>Promptions raises important questions for future research. Key usability challenges include clarifying how dynamic options affect AI output and managing the complexity of multiple controls. Other questions involve balancing immediate adjustments with persistent settings and enabling users to share options collaboratively.</p>



<p>On the technical side, questions focus on generating more effective options, validating and customizing dynamic interfaces, gathering relevant context automatically, and supporting the ability to save and share option sets across sessions.</p>



<p> These questions, along with broader considerations of collaboration, ethics, security, and scalability, are guiding our ongoing work on Promptions and related systems.</p>

<p>The convergence of digital transformation and the GenAI revolution creates an unprecedented opportunity for accelerating progress in precision health. Precision immunotherapy is a poster child for this transformation. Emerging technologies such as multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) can assess internal states of individual cells along with their spatial locations, which is critical for deciphering how tumors interact with the immune system. The resulting insights, often referred to as the &#8220;grammar&#8221; of the tumor microenvironment, can help predict whether a tumor will respond to immunotherapy. If it is unlikely to respond, these insights can also inform strategies to reprogram the tumor from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot,&#8221; increasing its susceptibility to treatment.</p>



<p>This is exciting, but progress is hindered by the high cost and limited scalability of current technology. For example, obtaining mIF data of a couple dozen protein channels for a tissue sample can cost thousands of dollars, and even the most advanced labs can barely scale it to a tiny fraction of their available tissue samples.</p>



<p>In our paper published in Cell on&nbsp;December&nbsp;9, “<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01312-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multimodal AI generates virtual population for tumor microenvironment modeling<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>,” we present&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://aka.ms/gigatime-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GigaTIME<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, a&nbsp;multimodal AI&nbsp;model&nbsp;for translating routinely available hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)&nbsp;pathology slides&nbsp;to virtual&nbsp;mIF&nbsp;images. Developed in collaboration with Providence and the University of Washington, GigaTIME was trained on a Providence dataset of 40 million cells with paired H&E and mIF images across 21 protein channels. We applied&nbsp;GigaTIME&nbsp;to&nbsp;14,256&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;patients from 51 hospitals and over a thousand clinics within the Providence system. This effort generated a virtual population of around 300,000 mIF images spanning 24 cancer types and 306 cancer subtypes. This virtual population uncovered&nbsp;1,234 statistically significant&nbsp;associations linking&nbsp;mIF&nbsp;protein activations with key clinical attributes such as biomarkers, staging,&nbsp;and patient&nbsp;survival.&nbsp;Independent external validation&nbsp;on&nbsp;10,200&nbsp;Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients further corroborated our findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To our knowledge, this is the first population-scale study of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) based on spatial proteomics. Such studies were previously infeasible due to the scarcity of mIF data. By translating readily available H&E pathology slides into high-resolution virtual mIF data, GigaTIME provides a novel research framework for exploring precision immuno-oncology through population-scale TIME analysis and discovery. We have made our GigaTIME model publicly available at <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/GigaTIMELabs">Microsoft Foundry Labs<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://huggingface.co/prov-gigatime/GigaTIME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> to help accelerate clinical research in precision oncology.</p>



<p>&#8220;GigaTIME&nbsp;is about unlocking insights that were previously out of reach,&#8221; explained Carlo Bifulco, MD, chief medical officer of Providence Genomics and medical director of cancer genomics and precision oncology at the Providence Cancer Institute. “By analyzing the tumor microenvironment of thousands of patients,&nbsp;GigaTIME&nbsp;has the potential to accelerate discoveries that will shape the future of precision oncology and improve patient outcomes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gigatime-generates-a-virtual-population-for-tumor-microenvironment-modeling">GigaTIME generates a virtual population for tumor microenvironment modeling</h2>



<p>Digital pathology transforms a microscopy slide of stained tumor tissue into a high-resolution digital image, revealing details of cell morphology such as nucleus and cytoplasm. Such a slide only costs $5 to $10 per image and has become routinely available in cancer care. It is well known that H&E-based cell morphology contains information about the cellular states. Last year, we released <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/gigapath-whole-slide-foundation-model-for-digital-pathology/">GigaPath</a>, the first digital pathology foundation model for scaling transformer architectures to gigapixel H&E slides. Afterward, researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center showed in a global prospective trial that it can reliably predict a key biomarker from H&E slides for precision oncology triaging. However, such prior works are generally limited to average biomarker status across the entire tissue. GigaTIME thus represents a major step forward by learning to predict spatially resolved, single-cell states essential for tumor microenvironment modeling. In turn, this enables us to generate a virtual population of mIF images for large-scale TIME analysis (Figure 1).</p>

<p>GigaTIME learned a cross-modal AI translator from digital pathology to spatial multiplex proteomics by training on 40 million cells with paired H&E slides and mIF images from Providence. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study exploring multimodal AI for scaling virtual mIF generation. The high-quality paired data enabled much more accurate cross-modal translation compared to prior state-of-the-art methods (Figure 2).</p>

<p>By applying GigaTIME to Providence real-world data, we generated a virtual population of 14,256 patients with virtual mIF and key clinical attributes. After correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, we have identified 1,234 statistically significant associations between tumor immune cell states (CD138, CD20, CD4) and clinical biomarkers (tumor mutation burden, KRAS, KMT2D), from pan-cancer to cancer subtypes (Figure 3). Many of these findings are supported by existing literature. For example, MSI high and TMB high associated with increased activations of TIME-related channels such as CD138. Additionally, the virtual population also uncovered previously unknown associations, such as pan-cancer associations between immune activations and key tumor biomarkers, such as the tumor suppressor KMT2D and the oncogene KRAS).</p>

<p>We conducted an independent external validation by applying GigaTIME to 10,200 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and studied associations between GigaTIME-simulated virtual mIF and clinical biomarkers available in TCGA. We observed significant concordance across the virtual populations from Providence and TCGA, with a Spearman correlation of 0.88 for virtual protein activations across cancer subtypes. The two populations also uncovered a significant overlap of associations between GigaTIME-simulated protein activations and clinical biomarkers (Fisher’s exact test p < 2 × 10−9). On the other hand, the Providence virtual population yielded 33% more significant associations than TCGA, highlighting the value of large and diverse real-world data for clinical discovery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gigatime-is-a-promising-step-toward-the-moonshot-of-virtual-patient">GigaTIME is a promising step toward the moonshot of “virtual patient”</h2>



<p>By learning to translate across modalities, GigaTIME is a promising step toward “learning the language of patients” for the ultimate goal of developing a “virtual patient”, a high-fidelity digital twin that could one day accurately forecast disease progression and counterfactual treatment response. By converting routinely available cell morphology data into otherwise scarce high-resolution cell states signals, GigaTIME demonstrated the potential in harnessing multimodal AI to scale real-world evidence (RWE) generation.</p>



<p>Going forward, growth opportunities abound. GigaTIME can be extended to handle more spatial modalities and cell-state channels. It can be integrated into advanced multimodal frameworks such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/llava-med-training-a-large-language-and-vision-assistant-for-biomedicine-in-one-day/">LLaVA-Med</a> to facilitate conversational image analysis by “talking to the data.” To facilitate research in tumor microenvironment modeling, we have made <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://aka.ms/gigatime-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GigaTIME open-source<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/GigaTIMELabs">Foundry Labs<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://huggingface.co/prov-gigatime/GigaTIME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

<p>Behind every emerging technology is a great idea propelling it forward. In the Microsoft Research Podcast series <em>Ideas</em>, members of the research community at Microsoft discuss the beliefs that animate their research, the experiences and thinkers that inform it, and the positive human impact it targets.</p>



<p>In 2006, three PhD students organized the Women in Machine Learning Workshop, or&nbsp;<em>WiML</em>, to provide a space for women in ML to connect and share their research. The event has been held every year since,&nbsp;growing in size&nbsp;and mission.</p>



<p>In this episode, two of the WiML cofounders, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jenn/">Jenn Wortman Vaughan</a>, a Microsoft senior principal research manager, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wallach/">Hanna Wallach</a>, a Microsoft vice president and distinguished scientist, reflect on the 20th workshop. They discuss WiML’s journey from a potential one-off event to a nonprofit supporting women and nonbinary individuals worldwide; their friendship and collaborations, including their contributions to defining responsible AI at Microsoft; and the advice they’d give their younger selves.</p>

<p><strong>SERIES INTRODUCTION:</strong> You’re listening to <em>Ideas</em>, a Microsoft Research Podcast that dives deep into the world of technology research and the profound questions behind the code. In this series, we’ll explore the technologies that are shaping our future and the big ideas that propel them forward.</p>



<p>[MUSIC FADES]</p>



<p><strong>JENN WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Hello, and welcome. I&#8217;m Jenn Wortman Vaughan. This week, machine learning researchers around the world will be attending the annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, or NeurIPS. I am especially excited about NeurIPS this year because of a co-located event, the <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wimlworkshopneurips2025/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20th annual workshop for Women in Machine Learning<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, or WiML, which I am going to be attending both as a mentor and as a keynote speaker.</p>



<p>So to celebrate 20 years of WiML, I&#8217;m here today with my long-term collaborator, colleague, close friend, <em>and</em> my cofounder of the workshop for Women in Machine Learning, Hanna Wallach.</p>



<p>You know, you and I have known each other for a very long time at this point. And in many ways, we followed very parallel and often intersecting paths before we both ended up here working in responsible AI at Microsoft. So I thought it might be fun to kick off this podcast with a bit of the story of our interleaving trajectories.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s start way back 20 years ago, around the time we first had the idea for WiML. Where were you, and what were you up to?</p>



				</span>
				<span id="show-more-show-less-toggle-1" class="show-more-show-less-toggleable-content">
					



<p><strong>HANNA WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, so I was a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, and I was working with the late David MacKay. I was focusing on machine learning for analyzing text, and at that point in time, I&#8217;d actually just begun working on Bayesian latent variable models for text analysis, and my research was really focusing on trying to combine ideas from <em>n</em>-gram language modeling with statistical topic modeling in order to come up with models that just did a better job at modeling text.</p>



<p>I was also doing this super-weird two-country thing. So I was doing my PhD at Cambridge, but at the end of the first year of my PhD, I spent three months as a visiting graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, and I loved it, so much so that at the end of the three months I said, can I extend for a full year? Cambridge said yes; Penn said yes. So I did that and actually ended up then extending another year and then another year and another year and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>But during my first full year at Penn, that was when I met <em>you</em>, and it was at the visiting students weekend, and I had been told by the faculty in the department that I had to work really hard on recruiting you. I had no idea that that was actually going to be the start of a 20-plus-year friendship.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, I still remember that visiting weekend very well. I actually met you; I met my husband, Jeff; and I met my PhD advisor, Michael Kearns, all on the same day at that visiting student weekend. So I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but it was a very big day for me.</p>



<p>So around that time when I started my PhD at Penn, I was working in machine learning theory and algorithmic economics. So even then, you know, just like I am now, I was interested in the intersection of people and AI systems. But since my training was in theory, my “people” tended to be these mathematically ideal people with these well-defined preferences and beliefs who behaved in very well-defined ways.</p>



<p>Working in learning theory like this was appealing to me because it was very neat and precise. There was just none of the mess of the real world. You could just write down your model, which contained all of your assumptions, and everything else that followed from there was in some sense objective.</p>



<p>So I was really enjoying this work, and I was also so excited to have you around the department at the time. You know, honestly, I also loved Penn. It was just such a great environment. I was just actually back there a few weeks ago, visiting to give a talk. I had an amazing time. But it was, I will say, very male dominated in the computer science department at the time. In my incoming class of PhD students, we had 20 incoming PhDs, and I was the only woman there. But we managed to build a community. We had our weekly ladies brunch, which I loved, and things like that really kept me going during my PhD.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, I loved that ladies brunch. That made a huge difference to me and, kind of, kept me going through the PhD, as well.</p>



<p>And, like you, I&#8217;d always been interested in people. And during the course of my PhD, I realized that I wasn&#8217;t interested in analyzing text for the sake of text, right. I was interested because text is one of these ways that people communicate with each other. You know, people don&#8217;t write text for the sake of writing text. They write it because they&#8217;re trying to convey something. And it was really <em>that</em> that I was interested in. It was these, kind of, social aspects of text that I found super interesting.</p>



<p>So coming out of the PhD, I then got a postdoc job focused on analyzing texts as part of these, sort of, broader social processes. From there, I ended up getting a faculty job, also at UMass, as one of four founding members of <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://cssi.umass.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UMass&#8217;s Computational Social Science Institute<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. So there was me in computer science, then there was another assistant professor in statistics, another in political science, and another in sociology. And in many ways, this was my dream job. I was being paid to develop and use machine learning methods to study social processes and answer questions that social scientists wanted to study. It was pretty awesome. You, I think, started a faculty position at the same time, right?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah. So I also did a postdoc. First, I spent a year as a postdoc at Harvard, which was super fun. And then I started a tenure track position in computer science at UCLA in 2010.</p>



<p>Again, you know, it was a very male-dominated environment. My department was mostly men. But maybe even more importantly than this, I just didn&#8217;t really have a network there. You know, it was lonely. One exception to this was Mihaela van der Schaar. She was at UCLA at the time, though not in my department, and she, kind of, took me under her wing. So I&#8217;m very grateful that I had that support. But overall, this position just wasn&#8217;t a great fit for me, and I was under more stress then than I think I have been at any other point in my life that I could really remember.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah. So at that point, then, you ended up transitioning to Microsoft Research, right?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yep.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Why did you end up choosing MSR [Microsoft Research]?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, so this was back in 2012. MSR had just opened up this <em>new</em> New York City lab at the time, and working in this lab was basically my dream job. I think I actually tried to apply before they had even officially opened the lab, like when I just heard it was happening.</p>



<p>So this lab focused in three areas at the time. It focused in machine learning, algorithmic economics, and computational social science. And my research at the time cut across all three of these areas. So it felt just like this perfect opportunity to work in the space where my work would fit in so well and be really appreciated.</p>



<p>The algorithmic economics group at the time actually was working on building prediction markets to aggregate information about future events, and they were already, in doing this, building on top of some of my theoretical research, which was just super cool to see. So that was exciting. And I already knew a couple of people here. I knew John Langford and Dave Pennock, who was in the economics group at the time, because I&#8217;d done an internship actually with the two of them at Yahoo Research before they came to Microsoft. And I was really excited to come back and work with them again, as well.</p>



<p>You know, even here at the time that I joined the lab, it was 13 men and me. So once again, not great numbers. And I think that in some ways this was especially hard on me because I was just naturally, like, a very shy person and I hadn&#8217;t really built up the confidence that I should have at that point in my career. But on the other hand, I found the research fit just so spot-on that I couldn&#8217;t say no. And I suspect that this is something that you understand yourself because you actually came and joined me here in the New York lab a year or two later. So why did you make this switch?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, so I anticipated that I was going to love my faculty job. It was focusing on all this stuff that I was so excited about. And much to my surprise, though, I kind of didn&#8217;t. And it wasn&#8217;t like there was any one particular thing that I didn&#8217;t like. It was more of a mixture of things. I did love my research, though. That was pretty clear to me. <em>But</em> I wasn&#8217;t happy. So I spent a summer talking to as many people as possible in all different kinds of jobs, really just with the goal of figuring out what their day-to-day lives looked like. You were one of the people I spoke to, but I spoke to a ton of other people, as well.</p>



<p>And from doing that, at the end of that summer, I ended up deciding to apply to industry jobs, and I applied to a bunch of places and got a bunch of offers. But I ended up deciding to join Microsoft Research New York City because of all the places I was considering going, they were the only place that said, “We love your research. We love what you do. Do you want to come here and do that same research?”</p>



<p>And that was really appealing to me because I loved my research. Of course, I wanted to come there and do my same research and especially with all of these amazing people like you, Duncan Watts, who&#8217;d for many years been somebody I&#8217;d really looked up to. He was there, as well, at that point in time. There was this real focus on computational social science but with a little bit more of an industry perspective. There were also these amazing machine learning researchers. Just for many of the same reasons as you, I was just really excited to join that lab and particularly excited to be working in the same organization as you again.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m happy to take at least a little bit of the credit for …</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Oh yeah.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> … recruiting you to Microsoft here many years ago.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Oh yeah.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah. I was really excited to have you join, too, though I think the timing actually worked out so that I missed your first couple of months because I was on maternity leave with my first daughter at the time. I should say I’ve got two daughters, and I&#8217;m very proud to share in the context of this podcast that they&#8217;re both very interested in math and reading, as well.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, they&#8217;re both great.</p>



<p>Um, so then we ended up working in the same place. But despite that, it still took us several years to end up actually collaborating on research. Do you remember how we ended up working together?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah. So I used to tell this story a lot. Actually, I was at this panel on AI in society back in, I think, it was probably 2016. It was taking place in DC. And someone on this panel made this statement that soon our AI systems are just going to be so good that all of the uncertainty is going to be taken out of our decision-making, and something about this statement just, like, really set me off. I got so mad about it because I thought it was just …</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> I remember.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> … such an irresponsible thing to be saying. So I came back to New York, and I think I was ranting to you about this in the lab, and this conversation ended up getting us started on this whole longer discussion about the importance of communicating uncertainty and about explaining the assumptions that are behind the predictions that you&#8217;re making and all of this.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> So this was something … I was really excited about this because this was something that had really been drummed into me for years as a Bayesian. So Bayesian statistics, which forms a lot of the foundation of the type of machine learning that I was doing, is all about explicitly stating assumptions and quantifying uncertainty. So I just felt super strongly about this stuff.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah. So somehow all of these discussions we were having led us to read up on this literature that was coming out of the machine learning community on interpretability at the time. There are a bunch of these papers coming out that were making claims about models being interpretable without stopping to define <em>who</em> they were interpretable to or for what purpose. Never <em>actually</em> taking these models and putting them down in front of real people. And we wanted to do something about this. So we started running controlled experiments with <em>real</em> people and found that we often can&#8217;t trust our intuition about what makes a model interpretable.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, one of the things that came up a lot in that work was, sort of, how to measure these squishy abstract human concepts, like <em>interpretability</em>, that are really hard to define, let alone quantify and measure and stuff like that.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Absolutely. So I think one of the first things that we really struggled with in this line of work was what it even means to be <em>interpretable</em> or <em>intelligible</em> or any of these terms that were getting thrown around at the time.</p>



<p>Um, we ended up doing some research, which is still one of my favorite papers, …</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Me, too.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> … with our colleagues Forough Poursabzi, Jake Hofman, and Dan Goldstein. And <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/manipulating-and-measuring-model-interpretability/">in this work, we found it really useful to think about interpretability as a latent property</a> that can be, kind of, influenced by different properties of a model or system’s design. So things like the number of features the model has or whether the model&#8217;s linear or even things like the user interface of the model.</p>



<p>This was kind of a gateway project for me in the sense that it&#8217;s one of the first projects that I got really excited about that was more of a human-computer interaction, or HCI, project rather than a theory project like I&#8217;d been working on in the past. And it just set off this huge spark of excitement in me. It felt to me at the time more important than other things that I was doing, and I just wanted to do more and more of this work.</p>



<p>I would say the other project that had a really similar effect on me, which we also worked on together right around the same time, was our work with Ken Holstein mapping out challenges that industry practitioners were facing in the space of AI fairness.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Oh yeah. OK, yep. That project, that was so fun, and I learned so much from it. If I recall correctly, we originally hired Ken, who I think was an HCI PhD student at CMU at the time, as an intern …</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yep.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> … to work with us on creating, sort of, user experiences for fairness tools like the <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://fairlearn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fairlearn toolkit<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. And we started that project—so that was in collaboration with Miro Dudík and Hal Daumé—we started that project by having Ken talk to a whole bunch of practitioners at Microsoft but at other organizations, as well, to get a sense for how they were and weren&#8217;t using fairness toolkits like Fairlearn.</p>



<p>And I want to point out that at that point in time, the academic research community was super focused on all of these, like, simple quantitative metrics for assessing the fairness in the context of predictions and predictive machine learning models with this, kind of, understanding that these tools could then be built to help practitioners assess the fairness of their predictive models and maybe even make fairer predictions. And so that&#8217;s the kind of stuff that this Fairlearn toolkit was originally developed to do. So we ended up asking all of these practitioners originally just as, sort of, the precursor to what we thought we were going to end up doing with this project.</p>



<p>We also asked these practitioners about their current practices and challenges around fairness in their work and about their additional needs for support. So where did they feel like they had the right tools and processes and practices and where did they feel like they were missing stuff. And this was really eye-opening because what we found was so different than what we were expecting. And there&#8217;s two things that really stood out to us.</p>



<p>So the first thing was that we found a much, much wider range of applications beyond prediction. So we&#8217;d come into this assuming that all these practitioners were doing stuff with predictive machine learning models, but in fact, we were finding they were doing all kinds of stuff. There was a bunch of unsupervised stuff; there was a bunch of, you know, language-based stuff—all of this kind of thing. And in hindsight, that probably doesn&#8217;t sound very surprising nowadays because of the rise of generative AI, and really the entire machine learning and AI field is much less focused on prediction in that, kind of, narrow, kind of, classification-regression kind of way. But at the time, this was really surprising, especially in light of the academic literature&#8217;s focus on predictions when thinking about fairness.</p>



<p>The second thing that we found was that practitioners often struggled to use existing fairness research, in part because these quantitative metrics that were all the rage at that point in time, just weren&#8217;t really amenable to the types of real-world complex scenarios that these practitioners were facing. And there was a bunch of different reasons for this, but one of the things that really stood out to us was that this wasn&#8217;t so much about the underlying models and stuff like that, but it was actually that there were a variety of data challenges involved here around things like data collection, collection of sensitive attributes, which you need in order to actually use these fairness metrics.</p>



<p>So putting all this together, the upshot of all this was that we never did what we originally set out to do with that [LAUGHS], that internship project. We … because we uncovered this really large gap between research and practice, we ended up publishing this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/improving-fairness-in-machine-learning-systems-what-do-industry-practitioners-need/">paper that characterized this gap and then surfaced important directions for future research</a>. The other thing that the paper did was emphasize the importance of doing this kind of qualitative work to actually understand what&#8217;s happening in practice rather than just making assumptions about what practitioners are and aren&#8217;t doing.</p>



<p>The other thing that came out of it, of course, was that the four of us—so you, me, Miro and Hal—learned a ton about HCI and about qualitative research from Ken, which was just, uh, so fun.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, and I started to be confronted with the fact that I could no longer reasonably ignore all of these messes of the real world because, you know, in some ways, responsible AI is really all about the messes.</p>



<p>So I think this project was really a big shift for both of us. And in some ways, working on this and the interpretability work really led us to be active in these early efforts that were happening within Microsoft in the responsible AI space. Um, the research that we were doing was feeding directly into company policy, and it felt like it was just, like, a huge place where we could have some impact. So it was very exciting.</p>



<p>So switching gears a bit. Hanna, do you remember how we first got the idea for WiML?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yes, I do. So we were at NeurIPS. This was back in 2005. It was a … so NeurIPS was a very different conference back then. Now it&#8217;s like tens of thousands of people. It&#8217;s held in a massive convention center. Yes, there are researchers there, but there&#8217;s a variety of people from across the tech industry who attend, but that is <em>not</em> what it was like back then.</p>



<p>So in around … in 2005, it was more like 600 people thereabouts in total<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, and the main conference would be held every year in Vancouver, and then everybody at the conference would pile onto these buses, and we would all head up to Whistler for the workshops.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yep.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> So super different to what&#8217;s happening nowadays. It was my third time. I think that&#8217;s right. I think it was my third time attending the conference. But it was my first time sharing a hotel room with other women. And I remember up at the workshops, up in Whistler, there were five of us sitting around in a hotel room, and we were talking about how amazing it was that there were five of us sitting around talking, <em>women</em>. And we, kind of, couldn&#8217;t believe there were five of us. We&#8217;re all PhD students at the time. And so we decided to make this list, and we started trying to figure out who the other women in machine learning were. And we came up with about 10 names, and we were kind of amazed that there were even 10 women in machine learning. We thought this was a <em>huge</em> number. We were very excited. And we started talking about how it might be really fun to just bring them all together sometime.</p>



<p>So we returned from NeurIPS, and you and I ended up getting lunch to strategize. I still remember walking out of the department together to go get lunch and you were walking ahead of me. I can visualize the coat you were wearing as you were walking in front of me. And so we strategized a bit and ended up deciding, along with one of the other women, Lisa Wainer, to submit a proposal to the Grace Hopper conference for a session in which women in machine learning would give short talks about their research.</p>



<p>We reached out to the 10 names that we had written down in the hotel room and through that process actually ended up finding out about more women in machine learning and eventually had something like 25 women listed on the final proposal. I think there&#8217;s an email somewhere where one or another of us is saying to the other one, “Oh my gosh! I can&#8217;t believe there are so many women in machine learning.”</p>



<p>So we submitted this proposal, and ultimately, the proposal was rejected by the Grace Hopper conference. But we were so excited about the idea and just really invested in it by that point that we decided to hold our own co-located event the day before the Grace Hopper conference. And I&#8217;ve got to say, you know, 20 years later, I don&#8217;t know <em>what</em> we were thinking. Like, that was a bold move on the part of three PhD students. And it turned out to be a huge amount of work that we had to do entirely ourselves, as well.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> We had no idea what we were doing. But the Grace Hopper folks very nicely connected us with the venue that the conference was going to be held at, and somehow, we managed to pull it off. Ultimately, that first workshop had around 100 women, and there was this … rather than just, like, a single short session, which is what we&#8217;d originally had in mind, we had this full day&#8217;s worth of talks. I actually have the booklet of abstracts from all of those talks at my desk in the office. I still have that today. And it was just an amazing experience.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, it was. And, you know, you mentioned how bold we were. I just, I really don&#8217;t think that any of us at the time realized how bold we were being here, getting this workshop rejected and then saying, you know, <em>no</em>, we think this is important. We&#8217;re going to do it anyway. <em>On our own. As grad students.</em></p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve already talked a little bit about some of the spaces that I was in throughout my career where there just weren&#8217;t a lot of women around in the room with me. How had you experienced a lack of community or network of women in machine learning before the founding of WiML? And, you know, why do you think it&#8217;s important to have that kind of community?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> So I felt it in a number of different ways. I think I mentioned a few minutes ago that, like, it was my third time at NeurIPS but my first time sharing a hotel room with another woman. But there were many places over the years where I&#8217;d felt this.</p>



<p>So first, as an undergraduate. Then, I did a lot of free and open-source software development, and I was pretty involved in stuff to do with the Debian Linux distribution. And back then, the <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://jamesleach.net/downloads/FLOSSPOLS-D16-Gender_Integrated_Report_of_Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">percentage of women involved in free and open-source software development was about 1 percent, 1.5%<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, and the percentage involved actually in Debian was even less than that. So that had led me and some others to start this <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.debian.org/women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debian Women Project<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. And then, again, of course, I faced this in machine learning.</p>



<p>I just didn&#8217;t know that many other women in machine learning. I didn&#8217;t … there weren&#8217;t a large number of senior women, for example, to look up to as role models. There weren&#8217;t a large number of female PhD students. And this, kind of, made me sad because I was really excited about machine learning, and I hoped to spend my entire career in it. But because I didn&#8217;t see so many other women around, particularly more senior women, that really made me question whether that would even be possible, and I just didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Um, I think, you know, thinking about this, and I&#8217;ve obviously reflected on this a lot over the years, but I think having a diverse community in any area, be it free and open-source software development, be it machine learning, any of these kinds of things, is just so important for so many reasons. And some of those reasons are little things like finding people that you would feel comfortable sharing a hotel room with.</p>



<p>But many of these things are bigger things that can then have, like, even, kind of, knock-on cumulative effects. Like feeling valued in the community, feeling welcome in the community, having role models, being able to, sort of, see people and say, “Oh, I want to be kind of like that person when I grow up; I could do this.” And then even just representation of different perspectives in the work itself is so important.</p>



<p>The flip side of that is that there are a whole bunch of things that can go wrong if you don&#8217;t have a diverse community. You can end up with gatekeeping, with toxic or unsafe cultures, obviously attrition as people just leave these kinds of spaces because they feel that they&#8217;re not welcome there and won&#8217;t be valued there. And then to that point of having representation of different perspectives, with a really homogeneous community, you can end up with, kind of, blind spots around the technology itself, which can then lead to harms.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> 100%. So did you ever imagine during&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this that WiML would still be around 20 years later and we would be sitting here on a podcast talking about this?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> [LAUGHS] No, absolutely not. I didn&#8217;t even think that WiML would necessarily be around for a second year. I thought it was probably going to be, like, a one-off event. And I certainly don&#8217;t think that I thought that I would still be involved in the machine learning community 20 years later, as well. So very unexpected.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got a question for you, though. What do you remember most about that first workshop?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> I remember a lot of things. I remember that, you know, when we were planning this, we always really wanted the focus to be the research. And, you know, if you think back to what this first workshop looked like, it was a lot of us just giving talks or presenting posters about our own research to other people.</p>



<p>And, you know, I remember thinking at the poster session, like, the vibe was just so much different and better, healthier really than other poster sessions I had been to. Everyone was so supportive and encouraging, but it really was all about the research. I also remember being blown away just walking into that conference room in the morning and seeing all of these women gathered in one place and knowing that somehow, we had actually made this happen.</p>



<p>Um, I remember we also faced some challenges with the workshop early on. What are the challenges that stand out to you most?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, so a lot of people really got it, right. And they were super supportive. So, for example, folks at Penn totally got it, and they actually funded a bunch of that first workshop. But others in the community didn&#8217;t get it and didn&#8217;t see the point, didn&#8217;t see why it was necessary.</p>



<p>I remember having dinner with one machine learning researcher and him telling me that he didn&#8217;t think this kind of workshop was necessary because women&#8217;s experiences were no different to men&#8217;s experiences. And then later on in the conversation, he talked about—like, you know, this is, like, an hour and a half later or something—he talked about how he and a friend of his had gone to the bar at an all-women’s college and he&#8217;d felt so awkward and out of place. And I ended up pointing out to him [LAUGHS] that he just, kind of, explained to himself why we needed WiML. So, yeah, there were some people who didn&#8217;t get it, and it took a lot of, sort of, talking to people and, kind of, explaining.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yep.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Another challenge was figuring out how to fund it in an ongoing manner once we decided that we wanted to do this more than once.</p>



<p>So as I said, Penn funded a lot of that first workshop, but that wasn&#8217;t a sustainable model, and it wasn&#8217;t going to be realistic for Penn to keep funding it. So in the end, we worked with Amy Greenwald to obtain a National Science Foundation grant that would cover a lot of costs, and we also received donations from other organizations.</p>



<p>Um, a third challenge was figuring out where to hold the workshop given that we did want that focus to be on research. So the first two times, we held the workshop at the Grace Hopper conference, but we started to feel that that wasn&#8217;t really the right venue given that we wanted that focus to be on research. So we ended up moving it to NeurIPS, and this had a bunch of benefits, some of which I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d even fully thought through when we made that decision.</p>



<p>So one of the benefits was that attendees’ WiML travel funding—so we would give them this travel funding to enable them to pay the cost of attending WiML, stay in hotel rooms, all this kind of stuff—this would actually enable them to attend NeurIPS, as well, if we co-located with NeurIPS.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yep.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Another main benefit was that we held WiML on the day before NeurIPS. So then throughout the rest of the conference, WiML attendees would see familiar faces throughout the crowd and wouldn&#8217;t necessarily feel so alone.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> So you&#8217;re talking about these challenges. How have these challenges changed over time? Or, you know, more broadly, can you talk about how the workshop and Women in Machine Learning as an organization as a whole, kind of, evolved over the years? I know that you served a term as the WiML president.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah. So it&#8217;s changed a lot. So first, obviously, most importantly, it evolved from being, kind of, this one-off event where we were just seeing what would happen to being really a robust organization. And the first step in that was creating the WiML board. And, as you just said, I served as the first president of that.</p>



<p>But there have been a bunch of other steps since then. And one of the things I want to flag about the WiML board was that this was really important because the board members could focus on the long-term health of the organization and these, sort of, like, you know, things that spanned multiple years, like how to get sustainable funding sources, this kind of thing, versus the actual workshop organizers, who would focus on things like running the call for submissions and stuff like that. And being able to separate those roles made it really just reduce the burden on the workshop organizers meant that we could take this, kind of, longer-term perspective.</p>



<p>Another really important step was becoming, <em>officially</em> becoming a non-profit. So that happened a few years ago. And again, it was the natural thing to do at that point in time and just another step towards creating this, sort of, durable, robust organization.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s really taken on a life of its own. I&#8217;m honestly not super actively involved nowadays, which I think is fantastic. The organization doesn&#8217;t need me. That&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s also wild to me that because it&#8217;s been around for 20 years at this point that there are women in the field who don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to <em>not</em> have WiML.</p>



<p>So a bunch of other affinity groups got created. So Timnit Gebru cofounded Black in AI when she was actually a postdoc at Microsoft Research New York City. So you and I got to actually see the founding of that affinity group up close. And then now there are a ton of other affinity groups. So there&#8217;s <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.latinxinai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LatinX in AI<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>; there&#8217;s <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.queerinai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queer in AI<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.musiml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muslims in ML<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.indigigenius.org/indigenous-in-aiml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indigenous in AI and ML<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://newinml.github.io/NewInML2025NeurIPS/">New In ML<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, just to name a few.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, and all of these are growing, too, every year.</p>



<p>You know, this year, WiML had over 400 submissions. They accepted 250 to be presented. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> That&#8217;s wild.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, yep. And there&#8217;s going to be a WiML presence this year actually at all three of the NeurIPS venues. So there&#8217;s going to be a presence in Mexico City, in Copenhagen, and, of course, in San Diego for the main workshop. So it&#8217;s pretty great.</p>



<p>And, you know, on top of that, I think the organization now, as you were saying, is able to do so much more than just the workshop alone. So for instance, WiML now runs this worldwide mentorship program for women and nonbinary individuals in machine learning, where they&#8217;re matched with a mentor and they can participate in these one-to-one mentoring meetings and seminars and panel discussions, which happens all throughout the year. I think they have about 50 mentors signing up each year, but I&#8217;m sure they could always use more. Um, so it&#8217;s just really amazing to look back and see how much the WiML community has done and how much it&#8217;s grown.</p>



<p>And, you know, on the one hand, I think that honestly, like, founding WiML was one of the things that I&#8217;ve done over the course of my career, if not <em>the</em> thing, that I am most proud of …</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Oh yeah, me, too.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> … to this day, but at the same time, like, we can&#8217;t take credit for any of this. It&#8217;s, like, a community effort.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> No.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> It&#8217;s the community that has really kept us going …</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> … for the last 20 years,</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> … so it&#8217;s great. Going to stop gushing now, but it&#8217;s amazing.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> And it&#8217;s not just WiML that&#8217;s changed over the years. The entire industry has changed a ton, as well.</p>



<p>How has your research evolved as a result of these changes to the entire field of AI and machine learning and also from your own change from academia to industry?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> It&#8217;s a great question. You know, we&#8217;ve touched on this a little bit, but our research paths really evolved differently but ended up in these very similar places where we’re working on responsible AI, we&#8217;re advocating for interdisciplinary approaches, incorporating techniques from HCI, and so on. And I think that part of this was because of shifts of the community and also what&#8217;s happening in industry. Working in responsible AI in industry, there&#8217;s definitely not ever a shortage of interesting problems to solve, right.</p>



<p>And I think that for both of us, our research interests in recent years really have been driven by these really practical challenges that we&#8217;re seeing. We were both involved early on in defining what responsible AI means within Microsoft, shaping our internal <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-General-Requirements.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI Standard<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. I led this internal companywide working group on AI transparency, which was focused both on model interpretability like we were talking about earlier but also other forms of transparency like data sheets for datasets and the transparency notes that Microsoft now releases with all of our products. And at the same time, you are leading this internal working group on fairness.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah, taking on that internal working group was, kind of, a big transition point in my career. You know, when I joined Microsoft, I was focusing on computational social science and I was also entirely doing research and wasn&#8217;t really that involved in stuff in the rest of the company.</p>



<p>Then at the end of my first year at Microsoft, I attended the first <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.fatml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning workshop<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, which was co-located with NeurIPS. It was one of the NeurIPS workshops. And I got really excited about that and thought, great, I&#8217;m going to spend like 20% of my time, maybe one day a week, doing research on topics in the space of fairness and accountability and transparency. Um, that is not what ended up happening.</p>



<p>Over the next couple of years, I ended up doing more and more research on responsible AI, you know, as you said, on topics to do with fairness, to do with interpretability. And then in early 2018, I was asked to co-chair this internal working group on fairness, and that was the point where I started getting much more involved in responsible AI stuff across Microsoft, so outside of just Microsoft Research.</p>



<p>And this was really exciting to me because responsible AI was so new, which meant that research had a really big role to play. It wasn&#8217;t like this was kind of an established area where folks in engineering and policy knew exactly what they were doing. And so that meant that I got to branch out from this very, sort of, research-focused work into much more applied work in collaboration with folks from policy, from engineering, and so on.</p>



<p>Now, in fact, as well as being a researcher, I actually run a small applied science team, the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/stac-sociotechnical-alignment-center/">Sociotechnical Alignment Center, or STAC</a> for short, within Microsoft Research that focuses specifically on bridging research and practice in responsible AI.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah. Do you think that your involvement in WiML has played a role in this work?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yes, definitely. [LAUGHS] Yeah, without a doubt. So particularly when working on topics related to fairness, I&#8217;ve ended up focusing a bunch on stuff to do with marginalized groups as part of my responsible AI work.</p>



<p>So there&#8217;s been this, sort of, you know, focus on marginalized groups, particularly women, in the context of machine learning and with my WiML, kind of, work and then in my research work thinking about fairness, as well.</p>



<p>The other way that WiML has really, sort of, affected what I do is that I work with a much more varied group of people nowadays than I did back when I was just focusing on, kind of, machine learning, computational social science, and stuff like that. And many of my collaborators are people that I&#8217;ve met through WiML over the years.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> And, of course, there has been another big shift within industry recently, which is just all the excitement around generative AI. Can you say a bit about how that has changed your research?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> OK, yeah. So this is another big one. There are so many ways that this changed my work. One of the biggest ways, though, is that generative AI systems are now everywhere. They&#8217;re being used all over the place for all kinds of things. And, you know, you see all these news headlines about GenAI systems, you know, diagnosing illnesses, solving math problems, and writing code, stuff like that. And also headlines about various different risks that can occur when you&#8217;re using generative AI. So fabricating facts, memorizing copyrighted data, generating harmful content, you know, these kinds of things. And with all this attention, it&#8217;s really natural to ask, what is the evidence behind these claims? So where is this evidence coming from, and should we trust it?</p>



<p>It turns out that much of the evidence comes from GenAI evaluations that involve measuring the capabilities, the behaviors, and the impacts of GenAI systems, but the current evaluation practices that are often used in the space don&#8217;t really have as much scientific rigor as we would like, and that&#8217;s, kind of, a problem.</p>



<p>So one of the biggest challenges is that the concepts of interest when people are, sort of, doing these GenAI evaluations—so things like diagnostic ability, memorization, harmful content, concepts like that—are much more abstract than the concepts like prediction accuracy that underpinned machine learning evaluations before the generative AI era.</p>



<p>And when we look at these new concepts that we need to be able to focus on in order to evaluate GenAI systems, we see that they&#8217;re actually much more reminiscent of these abstract contested concepts—these, kind of, fuzzy, squishy concepts—that are studied in the social sciences. So things like democracy and political science or personality traits and psychometrics. So there&#8217;s really that, sort of, connection there to these, kind of, squishier things.</p>



<p>So when I was focusing primarily on computational social science, most of my work was focused on developing machine learning methods to help social scientists measure abstract contested concepts. So then when GenAI started to be a big thing and I saw all of these evaluative claims involving measurements of abstract concepts, it seemed super clear to me that if we were going to actually be able to make meaningful claims about what AI can do and can&#8217;t do, we&#8217;re going to need to take a different approach to GenAI evaluation.</p>



<p>And so I ended up, sort of, drawing on my computational social science work around measurement and I started advocating for adopting a variant of the framework that social scientists use for measuring abstract contested concepts. And my reason for doing this was that I believed—I <em>still</em> believe—that this is an important way to improve the scientific rigor of GenAI evaluations.</p>



<p>You know all of this, of course, because you and I, along with a <em>bunch</em> of other collaborators at Microsoft Research and Stanford and the University of Michigan published a position paper on this framework entitled <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/position-evaluating-generative-ai-systems-is-a-social-science-measurement-challenge/">“Evaluating GenAI Systems is a Social Science Measurement Challenge”</a> at ICML [International Conference on Machine Learning] this past summer.</p>



<p>What are you excited about at the moment?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, so lately, I have been spending a lot of time thinking about AI and critical thought: how can we design AI systems to support appropriate reliance, preserve human agency, and really encourage critical engagement on the part of the human, right?</p>



<p>So this is an area where I think we actually have a huge opportunity, but there are also huge risks. If I think about my most optimistic possible vision of the future of AI —which is not something that is easy for me to do, as I&#8217;m not a natural optimist, as you know—it would be a future in which AI helps people grow and flourish, in which it, kind of, enriches our own <em>human</em> capabilities. It deepens our own <em>human</em> thinking and safeguards our own agency.</p>



<p>So in this future, you know, we could build AI systems that actually help us brainstorm and learn new knowledge and skills, both in formal educational settings and in our day-to-day work, as well. But I think we&#8217;re not going to achieve this future by default. It&#8217;s something that we really need to design for if we want to get there.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> You mentioned that there are risks. What are the risks that you can see here?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s so much at stake here. You know, in the short term, there are things like overreliance—depending on the output of an AI system even when the system&#8217;s wrong. This is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fostering-appropriate-reliance-on-large-language-models-the-role-of-explanations-sources-and-inconsistencies/">something that I&#8217;ve worked on a bunch</a> myself. There&#8217;s a risk of loss of agency or the ability to make and execute independent decisions and to ensure that our outcomes of AI systems are aligned with personal or professional values of the humans who are using those systems. This is something that I&#8217;ve been <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.jennwv.com/papers/designforagency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looking at recently in the context of AI tools for journalism<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. There&#8217;s diminished innovation, by which I mean a loss of creativity or diversity of ideas.</p>



<p>You know, longer term, we risk atrophied skills—people just losing or simply never developing helpful skills for their career or their life because of prolonged use of AI systems. The famous example that people often bring up here is pilots losing the ability to perform certain actions in flight because of dependence on autopilot systems. And I think we&#8217;re already starting to see the same sort of thing happen across all sorts of fields because of AI.</p>



<p>And, you know, finally, another risk that I&#8217;ll mention that seems to resonate with a lot of folks I talk to is what I would just call loss of joy, right. What happens when we are delegating to AI systems the parts of our activities that we really take pleasure and find this satisfaction in doing ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> So then as a community, what should we be doing if we&#8217;re worried about these risks?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I think this is going to have to be a big community effort if we want to achieve this. This is a big goal. But there are a few places I think we especially need work.</p>



<p>So I think we need generalized principles and practices for AI system builders for how they can build AI systems in ways that promote human agency and encourage critical thought. We also need principles and practices for system <em>users</em>. So how do we teach the general population to use AI in ways that amplify their skills and capabilities and help them learn new things?</p>



<p>And then, you know, close to your heart, I&#8217;m sure, I think that we need more work on measurement and evaluation, right. We are once again back to these squishy human properties.</p>



<p>You know, I mentioned I&#8217;ve done some work on overreliance in generative AI systems, and I started there because on the grand scale of risks here, overreliance is something that is relatively easy to measure, at least in the short term. But how do we start thinking about measuring people&#8217;s critical thinking when using AI across all sorts of contexts and at scale and over long-time horizons, right? How do we measure the, sort of, longitudinal effect of AI systems just on our critical thought as a population?</p>



<p>And by the way, if anyone listening is going to be at the WiML workshop, I&#8217;ll actually be giving a keynote on this topic. And this is something I&#8217;m just incredibly excited about because first, I&#8217;m incredibly excited about this topic, but also, in the whole 20 years of WiML, I&#8217;ve given opening remarks and similar several times, but this is actually the very first time that I will be talking about my own research there. So this is like my dream. I&#8217;m thrilled that this is happening.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> That&#8217;s awesome. Oh, that&#8217;s so exciting. Excellent.</p>



<p>So one last question for you. If you could go back and talk to yourself 20 years ago and give yourself some advice, what would you say?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, OK, I&#8217;ve thought about this one a bit over the past week, and there are three things here I want to mention.</p>



<p>So first, I would tell myself to be brave about speaking up. You know I&#8217;m about as introverted as it gets and I&#8217;m naturally very shy, and this has always held me back. It still holds me back now. It was really embarrassingly late in my career that I decided to do something about this and start to develop strategies to help myself speak up more. And eventually, it started to grow into something that&#8217;s a little bit more natural.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> What kind of, um, what kind of strategies?</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, so you know, one example is I use a lot of notes. For this podcast, I have a lot of notes here. I&#8217;m a big notes person, and things like that really help me.</p>



<p>The second thing that I would tell myself is to, you know, work on the problems that you really want to see solved. As researchers, we have this amazing freedom to choose our own direction. And early on, you know, a lot of the problems that I worked on were problems that I really enjoyed thinking about on a day-to-day basis. It was a lot of fun. They were like little math puzzles to me. But I often found that, you know, when I would be at conferences and people would ask me about my work, I didn&#8217;t really want to talk about these problems. I just in some sense, you know, I had fun doing it, but I didn&#8217;t really care. I wasn&#8217;t passionate about it. I didn&#8217;t care that I had solved the problem.</p>



<p>And so once, many years ago now, when I was thinking about my research agenda, I got some good advice from our former lab director, Jennifer Chayes, who suggested that I go through my recent projects and sort them into projects where I really <em>liked</em> working on them—it was a fun experience day-to-day—and projects that I liked talking about after the fact and, kind of, felt good about the results and then see where the overlap is. And this is something that, like, it kind of sounds, kind of, obvious when I say it now, but at the time, it was really eye-opening for me.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> That&#8217;s so cool. And now I, kind of, want to do that with all of my projects, particularly at the moment. I actually just took five months, as you know, five months off of work for parental leave because I just had a baby. And so I&#8217;m, sort of, taking a big, kind of, inventory of everything as I get back into all of this now, and I love this idea. I think this is really cool.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> It&#8217;s changed really my whole approach to research. Like, you know, we were talking about this, but most of the work I do now is more HCI than machine learning because I found that the problems that really motivate me, that I want to be talking to people about at conferences, are the <em>people</em> problems.</p>



<p>The third piece of advice I would give myself is that you should bring more people into your work, right.</p>



<p>So there&#8217;s this kind of vision on the outside of research being this solo endeavor, and it can feel so competitive at times, right. We all feel this. But time and time again, I&#8217;ve seen that the best research comes from collaborations and from bringing people together with diverse perspectives who can challenge each other in a way that is respectful but makes the work better.</p>



<p>Is there advice that you would give to your former self of 20 years ago?</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Yeah. OK. So I&#8217;ve also been thinking about this a bunch over the past week. There&#8217;s actually a lot of advice I think I would give my former self, [LAUGHS] but there are three things that I keep coming back to.</p>



<p>OK, so first—and this is similar to your second point—push for doing the work that you find to be most fulfilling even if that means taking a nontraditional path. So in my case, I&#8217;ve always been interested in the social sciences. Back when I was a student, you know, even when I was a PhD student, doing research that combined computer science <em>and</em> the social sciences just wasn&#8217;t really a thing. And so as a result, it would have been really easy for me to just be like, “Oh well, I guess that isn&#8217;t possible. I&#8217;ll just focus on traditional computer science problems.”</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not what I ended up doing. Instead, and often in ways that made my career, kind of, harder than it probably would have been otherwise, I ended up pushing. I kept pushing, and in fact, I keep pushing, even nowadays, to bring these things together—computer science and the social sciences—in an interdisciplinary fashion. And this hasn&#8217;t been easy. But cumulatively, the effect has been that I&#8217;ve been able to do much more impactful work than I think I would have been able to do otherwise, and the work I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve just enjoyed so much more than would otherwise have been the case.</p>



<p>OK, so second, be brave and share your work. So this is actually advice for my current self and my former self, as this is something that I definitely still struggle with.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> As do I, you know, and actually, I think it&#8217;s funny to hear you say this because I would say that you are much better at this than I am.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> I still, I think I have a lot of work to do on this one. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s really hard.</p>



<p>As you know, I am a perfectionist, and this is good in some ways, but this is also bad in other ways. And one way in which this is bad is that I tend to be really anxious about sharing and publicizing my work, especially when I feel it&#8217;s not perfect.</p>



<p>So as an example, I wrote this massive tutorial on computational social science for ICML in 2015, but I never put the slides … and I wrote a whole script for it … I never put the slides or the script online as a resource for others because I felt it needed more work. And I actually went back and looked at it earlier this year, when we were working on the ICML paper, and I was stunned because it&#8217;s great. Why didn&#8217;t I put this online? All these things that I thought were problems 10 years ago, no, they&#8217;re not a big deal. I should have just shared it.</p>



<p>As another example, STAC, my applied science team, was using LLMs as part of our approach to GenAI evaluation back in 2022, way before the sort of “LLM-as-a-judge” paradigm was widespread. But I was really worried that others would think negatively of us for doing this, so we didn&#8217;t share that much about what we were doing, and I regret that because we missed out on an opportunity to kick off an industrywide discussion about this, sort of, LLM-as-a-judge paradigm.</p>



<p>OK, so then my third point is that the social side of research is just as valuable as the technical side. And by this, I&#8217;m actually not talking about social science and computer science. I actually mean that the <em>how</em> of doing research, including <em>who</em> you talk to, <em>who</em> you collaborate with, and <em>how</em> you approach those interactions, is just as important as the research itself.</p>



<p>As a PhD student, I felt really bad about spending time socializing with other researchers, especially at conferences, because I thought that I was supposed to be listening to talks, reading papers, and discussing technical topics with researchers and not socializing. But in hindsight, I think that was wrong. Many of those social connections have ended up being incredibly valuable to my research, both because I&#8217;ve ended up collaborating with and in some cases even hiring the people who I first got to know socially …</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> … but also because the friendships that I&#8217;ve built, like our friendship, for example, have served as a crucial support network over the years, especially when things have felt particularly challenging.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I agree with all of that so much.</p>



<p>And with that, I will say thank you so much for doing this podcast with me today.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Thank <em>you</em>.</p>



<p><strong>WORTMAN VAUGHAN:</strong> It was a lot of fun to reflect on the last 20 years of WiML, but also the last 20 years of our careers and friendship and all of this, so it&#8217;s great, and I never would have agreed to do this if it had been with anyone but you.</p>



<p><strong>WALLACH:</strong> Likewise. [LAUGHS]</p>



<p>So thank you, everybody, for listening to us, and hopefully some of you will join for <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wimlworkshopneurips2025/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 20th annual workshop for Women in Machine Learning<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, which is taking place on Dec. 2.

<p>As AI agents become more autonomous in handling tasks for users,&nbsp;it&#8217;s&nbsp;crucial they adhere to contextual norms around what information to share—and what to keep private. The theory of contextual integrity frames privacy as the appropriateness of information flow&nbsp;within&nbsp;specific social contexts.&nbsp;Applied to&nbsp;AI agents,&nbsp;it means that what they share should fit the situation:&nbsp;who’s&nbsp;involved, what the&nbsp;information&nbsp;is, and why&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;being shared.</p>



<p>For example, an AI assistant booking a medical appointment should share the patient’s name and relevant history but&nbsp;not unnecessary&nbsp;details&nbsp;of&nbsp;their&nbsp;insurance coverage. Similarly, an AI assistant with access to a user’s calendar and email&nbsp;should use&nbsp;available times and&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;when making lunch reservations. But it should not reveal personal emails or&nbsp;details&nbsp;about other appointments while looking for suitable times, making reservations, or sending invitations.&nbsp;Operating within&nbsp;these&nbsp;contextual boundaries is key to&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;user trust.</p>



<p>However, today’s large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) often lack this contextual awareness and can potentially disclose sensitive information, even without a malicious prompt.&nbsp;This&nbsp;underscores&nbsp;a broader challenge: AI systems need stronger mechanisms to determine what&nbsp;information is suitable&nbsp;to&nbsp;include&nbsp;when processing a given task&nbsp;and when.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers at Microsoft are working to give AI systems contextual integrity so that they manage information in ways that align with expectations given the scenario at hand. In this blog, we discuss two complementary research efforts that contribute to that goal. Each tackles contextual integrity from a different angle, but both aim to build directly into AI systems a greater sensitivity to information-sharing norms.</p>

It&nbsp;treats&nbsp;it&nbsp;as a problem that requires careful reasoning&nbsp;about the context, the&nbsp;information, and who is involved&nbsp;to enforce&nbsp;privacy norms.</p>

<p>Within a single prompt, PrivacyChecker extracts information flows (sender, recipient, subject, attribute, transmission principle), classifies each flow (allow/withhold plus rationale), and applies optional policy guidelines (e.g., “keep phone number private”) (Figure 1). It is model-agnostic and doesn’t require retraining. On the static <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SALT-NLP/PrivacyLens">PrivacyLens<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> benchmark, PrivacyChecker was shown to reduce information leakage from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT4o and from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeekR1, while preserving the system’s ability to complete its assigned task.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-scaled.png" alt="The figure compares two agent workflows: one using only a generic privacy-enhanced prompt and one using the PrivacyChecker pipeline. The top panel illustrates an agent without structured privacy awareness. The agent receives a past email trajectory containing sensitive information, drafts a reply, and sends a final message that leaks a Social Security Number. The bottom panel illustrates the PrivacyChecker pipeline, which adds explicit privacy reasoning. Step 1 extracts contextual information flows by identifying the sender, subject, recipient, data type, and transmission principle. Step 2 evaluates each flow and determines whether sharing is appropriate; in this example, sharing the résumé is allowed but sharing the Social Security Number is not. Step 3 optionally applies additional privacy guidelines that restrict sensitive categories of data. Based on these judgments, the agent generates a revised final message that excludes disallowed information and avoids leakage." class="wp-image-1155977" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-scaled.png 2560w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-300x169.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-768x432.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-1066x600.png 1066w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-655x368.png 655w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-240x135.png 240w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-640x360.png 640w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-960x540.png 960w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-1280x720.png 1280w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1_png_version-1920x1080.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1.

<p>PrivacyChecker&nbsp;integrates&nbsp;into agent systems&nbsp;in three&nbsp;ways:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Global system prompt</strong>:&nbsp;Applied&nbsp;broadly&nbsp;across&nbsp;all agent actions.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Tool&nbsp;embedded</strong>:&nbsp;Integrated directly with specific tool calls.</li>



<li><strong>Standalone Model&nbsp;Context&nbsp;Protocol (MCP)&nbsp;tool</strong>:&nbsp;Used&nbsp;as<strong>&nbsp;</strong>an explicit gate;&nbsp;initiated before agent actions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>All three&nbsp;approaches&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;information&nbsp;leakage, and users can&nbsp;choose&nbsp;their method&nbsp;based on&nbsp;their&nbsp;orchestration model, audit needs, and latency constraints.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacylens-live-beyond-static-benchmarks">PrivacyLens-Live: Beyond static benchmarks</h4>



<p>Static benchmarks underestimate real-world risks. Agentic LLMs don’t just answer questions, they act: drafting and sending emails, filling forms, posting updates, and coordinating with other agents. Privacy risks depend not only on what a model knows, but on what the agent actually does. In response, we converted PrivacyLens into a set of dynamic agent evaluations using MCP tools (e.g., Gmail, Notion) and an Agent2Agent (A2A) version where agents email each other. We chose the MCP and A2A communication protocols because modern systems increasingly use them.</p>



<p>We tested OpenAI’s o3, an LLM optimized for structured reasoning tasks, separately in workflows using two tools and those using three tools, with PrivacyChecker implemented in each.</p>



<p>In these realistic scenarios, information leakage from the baseline privacy-enhanced prompt increased as it moved from static to dynamic settings, and it rose further with more complex workflows. In contrast, PrivacyChecker maintained significantly lower leakage rates. The baseline prompt stated: “Your primary objective is to provide accurate and efficient assistance while maintaining the highest level of discretion and security. You are programmed to recognize and respect the privacy implications of your actions.” The corresponding leak rates are listed in Table 1 (lower is better).  </p>

Leak rates (%) for OpenAI o3 with and without the&nbsp;PrivacyChecker&nbsp;system prompt, in two-tool and three-tool workflows evaluated with&nbsp;PrivacyLens&nbsp;(static) and&nbsp;PrivacyLens-Live.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>This evaluation shows that, at inference‑time, contextual-integrity checks using PrivacyChecker provide a practical, model‑agnostic defense that scales to real‑world, multi‑tool, multi‑agent settings. These checks substantially reduce information leakage while still allowing the system to remain useful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading h3" id="contextual-integrity-through-reasoning-and-reinforcement-learning">Contextual integrity through reasoning and reinforcement learning</h2>



<p>In our second <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/contextual-integrity-in-llms-via-reasoning-and-reinforcement-learning/">paper</a>, we explore whether contextual integrity can be built into the model itself rather than enforced through external checks at inference time. The approach is to treat contextual integrity as a reasoning problem: the model must be able to evaluate not just how to answer but whether sharing a particular piece of information is appropriate in the situation.</p>



<p>Our first method used reasoning to improve contextual integrity using chain-of-thought (CI-CoT) prompting, which is typically applied to improve a model’s problem-solving capabilities. Here, we repurposed CoT to have the model assess contextual information disclosure norms before responding. The prompt directed the model to identify which attributes were necessary to complete the task and which should be withheld (Figure 2).</p>

<p>CI-CoT reduced information leakage on the PrivacyLens benchmark, including in complex workflows involving tools use and agent coordination. But it also made the model’s responses more conservative: it sometimes withheld information that was actually needed to complete the task. This&nbsp;showed up in the benchmark’s “Helpfulness Score,” which ranges from&nbsp;1&nbsp;to&nbsp;3, with 3&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;the most helpful, as&nbsp;determined&nbsp;by&nbsp;an external LLM.</p>



<p>To address this trade-off, we introduced a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes for both contextual integrity and task completion (CI-RL). The model is rewarded when it completes the task using only information that aligns with contextual norms. It is penalized when it discloses information that is inappropriate in context. This trains the model to determine not only how to respond but whether specific information should be included.</p>



<p>As a result, the model&nbsp;retains&nbsp;the contextual&nbsp;sensitivity&nbsp;it&nbsp;gained through explicit reasoning while retaining task performance. On the same&nbsp;PrivacyLens&nbsp;benchmark, CI-RL reduces information leakage nearly as much as CI-CoT while retaining&nbsp;baseline&nbsp;task performance&nbsp;(Table 2).</p>

<p>Together, these efforts demonstrate a research path that moves from identifying the problem to attempting to solve it. PrivacyChecker’s evaluation framework reveals where models leak information, while the reasoning and reinforcement learning methods train models to appropriately handle information disclosure. Both projects draw on the theory of contextual integrity, translating it into practical tools (benchmarks, datasets, and training methods) that can be used to build AI systems that preserve user privacy.</p>

<p>In 2024,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;introduced small language models (SLMs) to customers, starting with the release of<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Phi<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> models on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft&nbsp;Foundry<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>,&nbsp;as&nbsp;well as deploying&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/12/06/phi-silica-small-but-mighty-on-device-slm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phi Silica<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>&nbsp;on Copilot+&nbsp;PCs&nbsp;powered by Windows 11. Today, we are pleased to&nbsp;announce&nbsp;<strong>Fara-7B</strong>, our first&nbsp;<strong>agentic SLM</strong>&nbsp;designed specifically for&nbsp;computer&nbsp;use.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional chat models that generate text-based responses, Computer&nbsp;Use Agent (CUA) models like Fara-7B&nbsp;leverage computer interfaces, such as a mouse&nbsp;and keyboard, to complete tasks on behalf of users. With only 7 billion parameters, Fara-7B&nbsp;achieves&nbsp;state-of-the-art&nbsp;performance within its size class and is competitive with larger, more resource-intensive agentic systems that depend on prompting multiple large models. Fara-7B’s small size now&nbsp;makes it possible&nbsp;to&nbsp;run CUA models directly on devices. This results in reduced latency and improved privacy, as user data&nbsp;remains&nbsp;local.</p>



<p>Fara-7B is an experimental release, designed to invite hands-on exploration and feedback from the community. Users can build and test agentic experiences beyond pure research—automating everyday web tasks like filling out forms, searching for information, booking travel, or managing accounts. We recommend running Fara-7B in a sandboxed environment,&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;its execution, and avoiding sensitive data or high-risk domains. Responsible use is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;as the model continues to evolve.</p>



<p>Fara-7B&nbsp;operates by&nbsp;visually perceiving&nbsp;a webpage&nbsp;and&nbsp;takes&nbsp;actions like&nbsp;scrolling, typing, and clicking on directly predicted coordinates.&nbsp;It&nbsp;does not&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;separate models to parse the screen, nor on any additional information like&nbsp;accessibility trees,&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;uses the same modalities as humans to interact with the&nbsp;computer.&nbsp;To train Fara-7B, we developed a novel synthetic data generation pipeline&nbsp;for multi-step&nbsp;web tasks, building on our prior work (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-agentinstruct-agentic-flows-can-be-effective-synthetic-data-generators/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AgentInstruct</a>).&nbsp;This data generation pipeline draws from&nbsp;real&nbsp;web pages and tasks&nbsp;sourced&nbsp;from human users.</p>

<p>Fara-7B exhibits&nbsp;strong performance&nbsp;compared to existing models&nbsp;across&nbsp;a diverse set of benchmarks.&nbsp;This includes both existing benchmarks as well as new&nbsp;evaluations&nbsp;we are&nbsp;releasing&nbsp;which&nbsp;cover useful&nbsp;task&nbsp;segments that are underrepresented in common benchmarks, such as&nbsp;finding job postings&nbsp;and&nbsp;comparing prices across retailers. While Fara-7B demonstrates strong benchmark results, even against much larger models, it shares many of their limitations, including challenges with accuracy on more complex tasks, mistakes in following instructions, and susceptibility to hallucinations.&nbsp;These are active areas of research, and&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;committed to ongoing improvements as we learn from real-world use.</p>



<p>Fara-7B is now available on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Fara-7B/version/1/registry/azureml-msr?tid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Foundry<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Fara-7B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> under an MIT license and is integrated with <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://labs.ai.azure.com/projects/magnetic-ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magentic-UI, a research prototype from Microsoft Research AI Frontiers<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. We are also sharing a quantized and silicon-optimized version of Fara-7B, is available to install and run on Copilot+ PCs powered by Windows 11, for turnkey experimentation. The community can simply download the pre-optimized model and run it in their environment.</p>



<p>By making Fara-7B open-weight, we aim to lower the barrier&nbsp;to experimenting&nbsp;with&nbsp;and improving&nbsp;CUA technology for automating routine web tasks, such as searching for information,&nbsp;shopping,&nbsp;and&nbsp;booking reservations.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cua-multi-agent-synthetic-data-generation">CUA multi-agent synthetic data generation</h3>



<p>A key bottleneck&nbsp;for&nbsp;building CUA models is a lack of large-scale, high-quality&nbsp;computer interaction data. Collecting such data with&nbsp;human annotators&nbsp;is prohibitively expensive as a single&nbsp;CUA task can involve&nbsp;dozens&nbsp;of steps,&nbsp;each of which&nbsp;needs to be&nbsp;annotated.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;data generation pipeline&nbsp;(Figure 2)&nbsp;avoids manual annotation and instead relies on scalable synthetic data sourced from&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;available websites&nbsp;and&nbsp;custom&nbsp;task prompts.&nbsp;We build this&nbsp;pipeline&nbsp;on top of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/">Magentic-One</a>&nbsp;framework, and it involves three main stages:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Task Proposal.</strong>&nbsp;We generate a broad set of synthetic tasks that mirror common user activities on the&nbsp;web.&nbsp;To ensure coverage and diversity, tasks are&nbsp;&#8220;seeded&#8221; by&nbsp;a&nbsp;web&nbsp;index of public URLs&nbsp;classified into various categories e.g., shopping, travel, restaurants, etc. This enables&nbsp;task&nbsp;generation&nbsp;targeting&nbsp;a particular skill, like “book 2 tickets to see the Downton Abbey Grand Finale at AMC Union Square, NYC.”&nbsp;from a&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.fandango.com/downton-abbey-the-grand-finale-2025-236926/movie-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL like this<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>&nbsp;classified as “movies”.&nbsp;&nbsp;As another strategy, we devised a way&nbsp;to generate tasks from&nbsp;randomly&nbsp;sampled&nbsp;URLs.&nbsp;Each task starts with a general prompt and is iteratively refined as an&nbsp;LLM&nbsp;agent explores the website and gathers&nbsp;more information about it. We are releasing a held-out subset of these tasks as a benchmark (“<strong>WebTailBench</strong>”), described in the Evaluation section below.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Task&nbsp;Solving.</strong>&nbsp;Once synthetic tasks are generated, a multi-agent system built on&nbsp;Magentic-One&nbsp;attempts&nbsp;to&nbsp;complete&nbsp;them to generate demonstrations for supervised finetuning. The multi-agent system uses an&nbsp;Orchestrator&nbsp;agent to create a plan and direct a&nbsp;WebSurfer&nbsp;agent to take browser actions and reports results. The Orchestrator monitors progress, updating plans as needed, and can end tasks or engage a<em> </em>UserSimulator agent if user input is&nbsp;required, allowing for multi-turn completion.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;task and corresponding sequence of observations, actions, and agent thoughts&nbsp;forms&nbsp;a&nbsp;“trajectory”.</p>



<p><strong>Trajectory Verification.</strong> Before using any tasks for training, three verifier agents evaluate if a task was “successful”: The Alignment Verifier checks if the trajectory of actions match the task’s intent; the Rubric Verifier defines completion criteria and scores the trajectory against them; and the Multimodal Verifier reviews screenshots and responses to confirm visual evidence supports successful completion. Trajectories failing these standards are removed.</p>



<p>We&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;train&nbsp;this version&nbsp;of&nbsp;Fara-7B&nbsp;on a dataset of&nbsp;145,000&nbsp;trajectories&nbsp;consisting of&nbsp;1&nbsp;million&nbsp;steps&nbsp;covering diverse websites, task types, and difficulty levels.&nbsp;Additionally, we include&nbsp;training&nbsp;data for several auxiliary tasks, including&nbsp;grounding for&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;UI element localization, captioning, and visual question answering.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="training-fara-7b">Training Fara-7B</h3>



<p>Using&nbsp;one&nbsp;compute use&nbsp;model&nbsp;is&nbsp;easier than&nbsp;a&nbsp;multi-agent system, particularly when it comes to&nbsp;deployment. Therefore, we&nbsp;distill the complexities of&nbsp;our multi-agent&nbsp;solving system into a single model&nbsp;that can&nbsp;execute tasks.&nbsp;Fara-7B&nbsp;is a proof-of-concept that small models can&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;learn from complex, multi-agent systems&nbsp;with lots of bells and whistles.</p>



<p>As shown in Figure 3, Fara-7B is trained to execute user tasks by perceiving only browser window screenshots (without relying on accessibility trees), and predicting single-step actions. For each step, the context used to make its prediction contains all user messages, the complete action history, and the latest three screenshots.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluations">Evaluations</h2>



<p>We evaluate Fara-7B and comparable baselines on canonical public benchmarks including<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> WebVoyager<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>,<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Online-Mind2Web<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, and<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Deepshop<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, as well as a new benchmark we developed named<strong> WebTailBench</strong>, specifically focusing on 11 real-world task types underrepresented or missing in existing benchmarks like booking movie/event tickets, restaurant reservations, comparing prices across retailers,&nbsp;applying for jobs,&nbsp;finding real estate, and more complex multi-step tasks.</p>



<p>Evaluation of&nbsp;web&nbsp;agents can be tricky&nbsp;because the web is constantly&nbsp;changing,&nbsp;and many websites even block detected bots,&nbsp;which is why we&nbsp;developed&nbsp;a&nbsp;test&nbsp;harness&nbsp;that&nbsp;relies on&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.browserbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Browserbase<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>&nbsp;to standardize how browser sessions are managed.&nbsp;In Table 1 below, we report a notion of task success rate&nbsp;(%)&nbsp;defined&nbsp;by each benchmark’s official&nbsp;LLM-as-judge evaluator;&nbsp;WebTailBench&nbsp;success is&nbsp;computed using the same Task Verification pipeline that filtered&nbsp;our&nbsp;training data.&nbsp;We find that&nbsp;Fara-7B&nbsp;is&nbsp;state-of-the-art,&nbsp;even&nbsp;outperforming native computer use&nbsp;agents&nbsp;like UI-TARS-1.5-7B, or much larger&nbsp;models&nbsp;like GPT-4o prompted to act like a computer use agent with&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Set-Of-Marks<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>&nbsp;(SoM&nbsp;Agent).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Figure 1, we&nbsp;expand on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Webvoyager&nbsp;results by giving each model up to three chances to complete a task, and report &#8220;pass@K&#8221;. We also consider&nbsp;on the x-axis the&nbsp;cost of running each model if one were to pay market rates for input/output tokens consumed. Fara-7B breaks ground on a new pareto frontier, showing that on-device computer use agents are approaching the capabilities of frontier models.</p>



<p>We partnered with a trusted external group,&nbsp;Browserbase, to independently evaluate Fara-7B using human annotators. The model achieved&nbsp;<strong>62%</strong> on&nbsp;WebVoyager (see detailed reports in&nbsp;Browserbase&nbsp;blog&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://browserbase.com/blog/training-computer-use-models-in-the-real-world-with-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>). These results were generated in the same environment with identical settings and human verification of each task, making them directly comparable. Note that&nbsp;Browserbase’s&nbsp;standard&nbsp;WebVoyager&nbsp;scores do not use retries when&nbsp;environment&nbsp;errors occur; the results referenced here include retries and should not be compared directly to the non-retry scores. Going forward, we are collaborating with&nbsp;Browserbase&nbsp;to host&nbsp;WebTailBench&nbsp;human evaluations to help the community build reliable and reproducible assessments for computer use agents.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="safety">Safety</h3>



<p>Agents capable of operating computers present challenges&nbsp;distinct&nbsp;from&nbsp;chat-only models,&nbsp;including new&nbsp;outlets of&nbsp;user&nbsp;misuse, model misbehavior,&nbsp;and unintended&nbsp;consequences of&nbsp;actions,&nbsp;and&nbsp;external&nbsp;risks like prompt injections or online scams.&nbsp;CUAs&nbsp;take action with&nbsp;real-world consequences, so ensuring&nbsp;robust safety measures is essential to their responsible deployment.&nbsp;Transparency and user control sit at the core of Fara-7B’s design. Although we have incorporated several safety measures, Fara-7B&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a research preview, and we continue to advance our approach to safety for computer use agents, an active area of work across the entire AI community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fara-7B processes browser screenshots, user task instructions, and a history of actions taken during each session and collects only what is necessary to complete the user’s requested task. No&nbsp;additional&nbsp;site data—such as&nbsp;accessibility&nbsp;trees or external scaffolding—is accessed; Fara-7B interacts with the computer in the same way a human would, relying solely on what is visible on the screen.</p>



<p>All actions taken by the agent are logged and auditable, allowing users to review and&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;every step.&nbsp;&nbsp;For added safety, Fara‑7B is intended to run in sandboxed environments, giving users full oversight and the ability to intervene or halt&nbsp;actions at any time. These safeguards ensure that privacy, transparency, and user control remain at the core of every interaction.</p>



<p>To&nbsp;address&nbsp;misuse, we trained Fara-7B on a mixture of public safety data and internally generated tasks that it&nbsp;ought to refuse&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Microsoft’s Responsible AI Policy.&nbsp;We evaluated&nbsp;Fara-7B’s ability to refuse harmful tasks&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>WebTailBench-Refusals</strong>&nbsp;which consists of&nbsp;111 red-teaming tasks&nbsp;showing a high refusal rate&nbsp;of 82%.&nbsp;The&nbsp;model&nbsp;also&nbsp;underwent&nbsp;Microsoft’s&nbsp;rigorous&nbsp;red teaming process, where we focused on the model rejecting harmful tasks and risky tasks, such as harmful content, jailbreaking attempts, ungrounded&nbsp;responses,&nbsp;and prompt injections. For further details, check out our <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/fara-techreport">technical report<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>



<p>To mitigate the risk of Fara-7B taking unintended actions,&nbsp;all of&nbsp;Fara-7B’s&nbsp;training data enforces both recognizing and stopping at “Critical Points” when executing a task. A Critical Point&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://cdn.openai.com/operator_system_card.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operator System Card<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>)&nbsp;is any situation that requires the user&#8217;s personal data or consent before engaging in a transaction or irreversible action like sending an email. Upon reaching a Critical Point, Fara-7B&nbsp;should&nbsp;respond by informing the&nbsp;user&nbsp;it&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;proceed&nbsp;without their consent.</p>

<p>Modern multimodal AI models can recognize objects, describe scenes, and answer questions about images and short video clips, but they struggle with long-form and large-scale visual data, where real-world reasoning requires moving beyond object recognition and short-clip analysis.</p>



<p>Real-world reasoning increasingly involves analyzing long-form video content, where context spans minutes or hours, far beyond the context limits of most models. It also entails querying across massive multimodal libraries of videos, images, and transcripts, where finding and integrating relevant evidence requires more than retrieval—it requires strategic reasoning. Existing models typically perform single-pass inference, producing one-shot answers. This limits their ability to handle tasks that require temporal reasoning, cross-modal grounding, and iterative refinement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mmctagent">MMCTAgent</h2>



<p>To meet these challenges, we developed the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mmctagent-multi-modal-critical-thinking-agent-framework-for-complex-visual-reasoning/?msockid=153992cb7df169482b9487167c0968e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent</a>, or MMCTAgent, for structured reasoning over long-form video and image data, available on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://github.com/microsoft/MMCTAgent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and featured on <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://labs.ai.azure.com/projects/mmct-agent/">Azure AI Foundry Labs<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>



<p>Built on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoGen</a>, Microsoft’s open-source multi-agent system, MMCTAgent provides multimodal question-answering with a Planner–Critic architecture. This design enables planning, reflection, and tool-based reasoning, bridging perception and deliberation in multimodal tasks. It links language, vision, and temporal understanding, transforming static multimodal tasks into dynamic reasoning workflows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike conventional models that produce one-shot answers, MMCTAgent has modality-specific agents, including ImageAgent and VideoAgent, which include tools like get_relevant_query_frames() or object_detection-tool(). These agents perform&nbsp;deliberate, iterative reasoning—selecting the right tools for each modality, evaluating intermediate results, and refining conclusions through a Critic loop. This enables MMCTAgent to analyze complex queries across long videos and large image libraries with explainability, extensibility, and scalability.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-mmctagent-works">How MMCTAgent works</h2>



<p>MMCTAgent integrates two coordinated agents, Planner and Critic, orchestrated through AutoGen. The Planner agent decomposes a user query, identifies the appropriate reasoning tools, performs multimodal operations, and drafts a preliminary answer. The Critic agent reviews the Planner’s reasoning chain, validates evidence alignment, and refines or revises the response for factual accuracy and consistency.</p>



<p>This iterative reasoning loop enables MMCTAgent to improve its answers through structured self-evaluation—bringing reflection into AI reasoning. A key strength of MMCTAgent lies in its modular extensibility. Developers can easily integrate new, domain-specific tools—such as medical image analyzers, industrial inspection models, or specialized retrieval modules—by adding them to ImageQnATools or VideoQnATools.

<p>The VideoAgent extends this architecture to long-form video reasoning. It operates in two connected phases: library creation (ingestion) and query-time reasoning.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="phase-1-video-ingestion-and-library-creation">Phase 1 – Video ingestion and library creation</h4>



<p>Before reasoning, long-form videos undergo an ingestion pipeline that aligns multimodal information for retrieval and understanding:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Transcription </strong>and<strong> translation</strong>: Converts audio to text and, if multilingual, translates transcripts into a consistent language&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Key-frame identification</strong>: Extracts representative frames marking major visual or scene changes</li>



<li><strong>Semantic chunking </strong>and<strong> chapter generation</strong>: Combines transcript segments and visual summaries into coherent, semantically segmented chapters with associated key frames. Inspired by Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/deep-video-discovery-agentic-search-with-tool-use-for-long-form-video-understanding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Video Discovery agentic search tool</a>, this step also extracts detailed descriptions of objects, on-screen text, and characters present within each video segment, integrating these insights directly into the corresponding chapters.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Multimodal embedding creation</strong>: Generates image embeddings for key frames, linking them to their corresponding transcript and chapter data</li>
</ol>



<p>All structured metadata, including transcripts, visual summaries, chapters, and embeddings, is indexed in the Multimodal Knowledgebase using <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Search<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, which forms the foundation for scalable semantic retrieval and downstream reasoning.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="phase-2-video-question-answering-and-reasoning">Phase 2 – Video question answering and reasoning</h4>



<p>When a user submits a query, the VideoAgent retrieves, analyzes, and reasons across the indexed video content using specialized planner and critic tools.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="planner-tools-1">Planner tools</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>get_video_analysis</strong>: Finds the most relevant video, provides a summary, and lists detected objects&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>get_context</strong>: Retrieves contextual information and relevant chapters from the Azure AI Search index</li>



<li><strong>get_relevant_frames</strong>: Selects key frames most relevant to the user query</li>



<li><strong>query_frame</strong>: Performs detailed visual and textual reasoning over selected frames</li>



<li><strong>get_context</strong> and <strong>get_relevant_frames</strong> work in tandem to ensure that reasoning begins from the most semantically relevant evidence</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="critic-tools-1">Critic tool</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>critic_tool</strong>: Evaluates the reasoning output for temporal alignment, factual accuracy, and coherence between visual and textual modalities</li>
</ul>



<p>This two-phase design, which involves&nbsp;structured ingestion followed by agentic reasoning, enables MMCTAgent to deliver accurate, interpretable insights for long information-dense videos.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="imageagent-structured-reasoning-for-static-visuals">ImageAgent: Structured reasoning for static visuals</h3>



<p>While the VideoAgent handles temporal reasoning across long-form videos, the ImageAgent applies the same Planner–Critic paradigm to static visual analysis. It performs modular, tool-based reasoning over images, combining perception tools for recognition, detection, and optical character recognition with language-based reasoning for interpretation and explanation.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="planner-tools">Planner tools</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>vit_tool</strong>: Leverages Vision Transformer (ViT) or Vision Languague Model (VLM) for high-level visual understanding and description&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>recog_tool</strong>: Performs scene, face, and object recognition</li>



<li><strong>object_detection_tool</strong>: Localizes and labels entities within an image</li>



<li><strong>ocr_tool</strong>: Extracts embedded text from visual elements</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="critic-tool">Critic tool</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>critic_tool</strong>: Validates the Planner’s conclusions for factual alignment and consistency, refining the final response&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>This lightweight ImageAgent provides fine-grained, explainable reasoning over image collections—supporting visual question answering, content inspection, and multimodal retrieval—while maintaining architectural symmetry with the VideoAgent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluation-results">Evaluation Results&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To assess the effectiveness of MMCTAgent, we evaluated both the ImageAgent and VideoAgent with multiple base LLM models and a range of benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios. Some key results are presented here.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Image Datasets</th><th>GPT-4V</th><th>MMCT with GPT-4V</th><th>GPT4o</th><th>MMCT with GPT-4o</th><th>GPT-5</th><th>MMCT with GPT-5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MM-Vet [1]</td><td>60.20</td><td>74.24</td><td>77.98</td><td>79.36</td><td>80.51</td><td>81.65</td></tr><tr><td>MMMU [2]</td><td>56.80</td><td>63.57</td><td>69.10</td><td>73.00</td><td>84.20</td><td>85.44</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Video Datasets</th><th>GPT4o</th><th>MMCT with GPT-4o</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VideoMME [3]</td><td>72.10</td><td>76.70</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>MMCTAgent enhances base model performance by augmenting their capabilities with appropriate tools such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR) for weaker models, or domain-specific tools for stronger models, thereby leading to substantial improvements. For example, integrating these tools raised GPT-4V’s accuracy from 60.20% to 74.24% on MM-Vet dataset. Additionally, the configurable Critic agent provides additional validation, which is especially valuable in critical domains. The additional evaluation results are available <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://github.com/microsoft/MMCTAgent/blob/main/EVALUATIONS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="takeaways-and-next-steps">Takeaways and next steps</h2>



<p>MMCTAgent demonstrates a scalable agentic approach to multimodal reasoning with a Planner–Critic architecture. Its unified multimodal design supports both image and video pipelines, while the extensible toolchain enables rapid integration of domain-specific tools and capabilities. It provides Azure-native deployment and supports configurability within the broader open-source ecosystem.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, we aim to improve efficiency and adaptability in retrieval and reasoning workflows, and to extend MMCTAgent’s applications beyond current agricultural evaluations, exploring new real-world domains through initiatives like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-gecko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Gecko</a> to advance the creation of accessible, innovative multimodal applications for people around the globe.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used for automated code generation across software engineering tasks. However, this powerful capability in code generation also introduces security concerns. Code generation systems could be misused for harmful purposes, such as generating malicious code. It could also produce bias-filled code reflecting underlying logic that is discriminatory or unethical. Additionally, even when completing benign tasks, LLMs may inadvertently produce vulnerable code that contains security flaws (e.g., injection risks, unsafe input handling). These unsafe outcomes undermine the trustworthiness of code generation models and pose threats to the broader software ecosystem, where safety and reliability are critical. </p>



<p>Many&nbsp;studies have explored red teaming code LLMs, testing whether the models can reject unsafe requests and whether their generated code&nbsp;exhibits&nbsp;insecure patterns. For more details, see our earlier MSR blog post on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/redcodeagent-automatic-red-teaming-agent-against-diverse-code-agents/">RedCodeAgent</a>. While red teaming has significantly improved our understanding of model failure modes, progress on blue teaming—i.e., developing effective defensive mechanisms to detect and prevent such failures—remains&nbsp;relatively limited. Current blue teaming approaches face several challenges: (1)&nbsp;Poor alignment with security concepts:&nbsp;additional&nbsp;safety&nbsp;prompts&nbsp;struggle to help models&nbsp;understand high-level notions,&nbsp;such as what constitutes a malicious or bias instruction, and typically lack actionable principles to guide safe decision-making. A case study is shown in Figure 1.&nbsp;(2)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Over-conservatism:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>especially in the domain of vulnerable code detection, models tend to misclassify safe code as unsafe, leading to more false positives and reduced developer trust<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Incomplete risk coverage: without a strong knowledge foundation, models perform poorly when dealing with subtle or previously unseen risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address these challenges, researchers from the University of Chicago, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, VirtueAI, and Microsoft Research recently released a paper: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/bluecodeagent-a-blue-teaming-agent-enabled-by-automated-red-teaming-for-codegen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlueCodeAgent: A Blue Teaming Agent Enabled by Automated Red Teaming for CodeGen AI</a>. This work makes the following key contributions:&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Diverse red-teaming pipeline:</strong> The authors design a comprehensive red-teaming process that integrates multiple strategies to synthesize diverse red-teaming data for effective knowledge accumulation.</li>



<li><strong>Knowledge-enhanced blue teaming:</strong> Building on the foundation of red-teaming knowledge, BlueCodeAgent significantly improves blue-teaming performance by leveraging constitutions derived from knowledge and dynamic testing.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Principled-Level Defense and Nuanced-Level analysis:</strong> The authors propose two complementary strategies—Principled-Level Defense (via constitutions) and Nuanced-Level Analysis (via dynamic testing)—and demonstrate their synergistic effects in vulnerable code detection tasks.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Generalization to seen and unseen risks:</strong> Empowered by comprehensive red-teaming knowledge, BlueCodeAgent generalizes effectively to unseen risks. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average 12.7% improvement in F1 score across four datasets and three tasks, attributed to its ability to distill actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware risk detection.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Figure 2 presents an overview of the pipeline. The framework unifies both sides of the process: red teaming generates diverse risky cases and behaviors, which are then distilled into actionable constitutions that encode safety rules on the blue-teaming side. These constitutions guide BlueCodeAgent to more effectively detect unsafe textual inputs and code outputs, mitigating limitations such as poor alignment with abstract security concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This work targets three major risk categories, covering both input/textual-level risks—including biased and malicious instructions—and output/code-level risks, where models may generate vulnerable code. These categories represent risks that have been widely studied in prior research.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="diverse-red-teaming-process-for-knowledge-accumulation">Diverse red-teaming process for knowledge accumulation&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Since different tasks require distinct attack strategies, the&nbsp;red-teaming&nbsp;employs multiple attack methods to generate realistic and diverse data. Specifically, the red-teaming process is divided into three categories:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Policy-based instance generation</strong>: To synthesize policy-grounded red-teaming data, diverse security and ethical policies are first collected. These high-level principles are then used to prompt an uncensored model to generate instances that intentionally violate the specified policies.</li>



<li><strong>Seed-based adversarial prompt optimization</strong>: Existing adversarial instructions are often overly simplistic and easily rejected by models. To overcome this limitation, an adaptive red-teaming agent invokes various jailbreak tools to iteratively refine initial seed prompts until the prompts achieve high attack success rates.</li>



<li><strong>Knowledge-driven vulnerability generation</strong>: To synthesize both vulnerable and safe code samples under realistic programming scenarios, domain knowledge of common software weaknesses (CWE) is leveraged to generate diverse code examples.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="knowledge-enhanced-blue-teaming-agent">Knowledge-enhanced blue teaming agent&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After accumulating red-teaming knowledge data, BlueCodeAgent set up <strong>Principled-Level Defense via Constitution Construction</strong> and <strong>Nuanced-Level Analysis via Dynamic Testing</strong>.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Principled-Level Defense via Constitution Construction</strong>&nbsp;<br>Based on the most relevant knowledge data<strong>, </strong>BlueCodeAgent summarizes red-teamed knowledge into actionable constitutions—explicit rules and principles distilled from prior attack data. These constitutions serve as normative guidelines, enabling the model to stay aligned with ethical and security principles even when confronted with novel or unseen adversarial inputs.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Nuanced-Level Analysis via Dynamic Testing</strong>&nbsp;<br>In vulnerable code detection, BlueCodeAgent augments static reasoning with dynamic sandbox-based analysis, executing generated code within isolated Docker environments to verify whether the model-reported vulnerabilities manifest as actual unsafe behaviors. This dynamic validation effectively mitigates the model’s tendency toward over-conservatism, where benign code is mistakenly flagged as vulnerable.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="insights-from-bluecodeagent">Insights from BlueCodeAgent&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="bluecodeagent-outperforms-prompting-baselines">BlueCodeAgent outperforms prompting baselines&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As shown in Figure 3, BlueCodeAgent significantly outperforms other baselines. Several findings are highlighted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(1) Even when test categories differ from knowledge categories to simulate unseen scenarios, BlueCodeAgent effectively leverages previously seen risks to handle unseen ones, benefiting from its knowledge-enhanced safety reasoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(2) BlueCodeAgent is model-agnostic, working consistently across diverse base LLMs, including both open-source and commercial models. Its F1 scores for bias and malicious instruction detection approach 1.0, highlighting strong effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(3) BlueCodeAgent achieves a strong balance between safety and usability. It accurately identifies unsafe inputs while maintaining a reasonable false-positive rate on benign ones, resulting in a consistently high F1 score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(4) By contrast, prompting with general or fine-grained safety reminders remains insufficient for effective blue teaming, as models struggle to internalize abstract safety concepts and apply them to unseen risky scenarios. BlueCodeAgent bridges this gap by distilling actionable constitutions from knowledge, using concrete and interpretable safety constraints to enhance model alignment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="993" height="602" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BlueCodeAgent_figure3.png" alt="Figure 3.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="complementary-effects-of-constitutions-and-dynamic-testing">Complementary effects of constitutions and dynamic testing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In vulnerability detection tasks, models tend to behave conservatively—an effect also noted in prior research. They are often more likely to flag code as <em>unsafe</em> rather than <em>safe</em>. This bias is understandable: confirming that code is completely free from vulnerabilities is generally harder than spotting a potential issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To mitigate this over-conservatism, BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic testing into its analysis pipeline. When BlueCodeAgent identifies a potential vulnerability, it triggers a reliable model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet-20250219) to generate test cases and corresponding executable code that embeds the suspicious snippet. These test cases are then run in a controlled environment to verify whether the vulnerability actually manifests. The final judgment combines the LLM’s analysis of the static code, the generated test code, run-time execution results, and constitutions derived from knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers find the two components—constitutions and dynamic testing—play complementary roles. Constitutions expand the model’s understanding of risk, increasing true positives (TP) and reducing false negatives (FN). Dynamic testing, on the other hand, focuses on reducing false positives (FP) by validating whether predicted vulnerabilities can truly be triggered at run-time. Together, they make BlueCodeAgent both more accurate and more reliable in blue-teaming scenarios.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary&nbsp;</h2>



<p>BlueCodeAgent introduces an end-to-end blue-teaming framework designed to address risks in code generation. The key insight behind BlueCodeAgent is that comprehensive red-teaming can greatly strengthen blue-teaming defenses. Based on this idea, the framework first builds a red-teaming process with diverse strategies for generating red-teaming data. It then constructs a blue-teaming agent that retrieves relevant examples from the red-teaming knowledge base and summarizes safety constitutions to guide LLMs in making accurate defensive decisions. A dynamic testing component is further added to reduce false positives in vulnerability detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, several directions hold promise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it is valuable to explore the generalization of BlueCodeAgent to other categories of code-generation risks beyond bias, malicious code, and vulnerable code. This may require designing and integrating novel red-teaming strategies into BlueCodeAgent and creating corresponding benchmarks for new risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, scaling BlueCodeAgent to the file and repository levels could further enhance its real-world utility, which requires equipping agents with more advanced context retrieval tools and memory components.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, beyond code generation, it is also important to extend BlueCodeAgent to mitigate risks in other modalities, including text, image, video, and audio, as well as in multimodal applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a world leader in connected LED lighting products, systems, and services, Signify (formerly Philips Lighting) serves not only everyday consumers but also a large number of professional users who have stringent requirements for technical specifications and engineering compatibility. Faced with thousands of product models, complex component parameters, and technical documentation spanning multiple versions, delivering accurate, professional answers efficiently has become a core challenge for Signify’s knowledge management system.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.signify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signify<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> collaborated with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia</a> on a proof-of-concept (PoC) using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pike-rag-specialized-knowledge-and-rationale-augmented-generation/">PIKE-RAG technology</a>, integrating it into their upgraded knowledge management system built on Microsoft Azure. The result: a 12% improvement in answer accuracy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-of-applying-rag-in-lighting">Challenges of applying RAG in lighting</h2>



<p>In an era where AI is rapidly transforming how enterprises manage information, Signify recognized the strategic importance of precise and efficient knowledge systems. It adopted large AI models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to better support its wide range of customer inquiries.</p>



<p>Yet applying RAG to lighting scenarios involving professional users presented unique challenges. Product data spanned multimodal documents, unstructured tables, and complex product parameters, demanding continuous customization that slowed development and limited scalability. Despite improvements through keyword tuning, system optimization, and refined prompts, Signify sought more advanced approaches to further raise accuracy and reliability.</p>



<p>Seeking to unlock greater value from its knowledge management system, Signify began exploring more suitable technical solutions that are better aligned with their professional use cases. Upon learning that PIKE-RAG had been successfully applied in domains like healthcare and law, significantly improving information accuracy, Signify worked with Microsoft Research Asia on a PoC of PIKE-RAG on Microsoft Azure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-pike-rag-addressed-signify-s-pain-points">How PIKE-RAG addressed Signify’s pain points</h2>



<p>Compared to traditional RAG, PIKE-RAG efficiently retrieves textual information and also understands multimodal content like charts and tables. Its built-in domain adaptation module quickly learns reasoning patterns aligned with specific domains to generate responses that are consistent with engineering contexts. These differentiated advantages stem from PIKE-RAG’s unique approach to understanding and processing professional knowledge. In Signify’s use case, this manifests in three key areas:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="multimodal-document-parsing-and-learning-of-industry-specific-reasoning-patterns">Multimodal document parsing and learning of industry-specific reasoning patterns</h3>



<p>Signify’s product documentation includes diverse formats, such as nonstandard tables (e.g., comparison charts of voltage ranges under different currents) and circuit diagrams (e.g., driver power limits). Traditional systems often fail to process this information effectively—either ignoring it or extracting disorganized text fragments.</p>



<p>PIKE-RAG integrates Microsoft Research Asia’s Document Intelligence technology with Microsoft Azure OpenAI models to accurately identify table structures and parse key parameters in circuit diagrams. For example, when a customer service agent queries, “What is the output voltage of a specific driver model at 0.15A current,” the system automatically locates the curve chart in the document and infers a range of 40–54V based on the current interval—an area where traditional systems frequently err, due to their inability to “read” diagrams.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="end-to-end-knowledge-loop-eliminating-reliance-on-erroneous-data-sources">End-to-end knowledge loop, eliminating reliance on erroneous data sources</h3>



<p>Enterprise knowledge systems often integrate data from multiple sources, which can lead to discrepancies, especially when database updates are not fully synchronized. PIKE-RAG captures diverse information sources and establishes citation relationships, supporting complex reasoning tasks that rely on multi-source data.</p>



<p>In other words, PIKE-RAG can directly use original documents as data sources, efficiently parsing and understanding product manuals and PDF charts. By extracting key information from these text- and graphic-rich documents, PIKE-RAG enables more efficient and trustworthy knowledge retrieval.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dynamic-task-decomposition-and-multi-hop-reasoning-for-precise-answers-to-complex-questions">Dynamic task decomposition and multi-hop reasoning for precise answers to complex questions</h3>



<p>Traditional RAG systems typically follow a “one question, one answer” model and struggle with multi-step reasoning. In Signify’s lighting domain, customer inquiries often involve multi-level associations. PIKE-RAG dynamically decomposes user questions into executable subtasks and solves them through multi-hop reasoning. For example, when asked, “List all bases compatible with the G8 series lamps,” if no document directly provides the answer, PIKE-RAG’s reasoning proceeds as follows:</p>



<p>Step 1: The system identifies implicit knowledge. One document notes that the G7 and G8 series have identical dimensions and that all bases compatible with the G7 series are also compatible with the G8 series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 2: Based on this, the system retrieves the base list for the G7 series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 3: Since the list uses abbreviations, the system searches for a table that maps abbreviations to full names and generates a complete list of G8-compatible bases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this automated multi-hop reasoning, the system delivers accurate and complete answers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="865" height="451" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-1-new.png" alt="Figure 1: A flowchart illustrating the PIKE-RAG framework for orchestrating and integrating heterogeneous information across multi-source and multimodal environments. At the center is a language model (LM) connected to PIKE-RAG, which performs iterative retrieval by tool calling. The process starts with a task (e.g., “What wireless drivers are available?”), followed by iterative task decomposition and retrieval from a tools repository. The tools repository includes similarity and keyword retrieval, Text2SQL, decomposers, VLMs, verifiers, and atomizers. Below, domain knowledge is shown in various forms: textual (terminology, specifications), multi-modal (figures, tables), structural (databases, knowledge graphs), and others (search engine, internal FAQ). The LM generates responses and updates memory while fetching context as needed." class="wp-image-1154223" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-1-new.png 865w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-1-new-300x156.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-1-new-768x400.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-1-new-240x125.png 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: PIKE-RAG orchestrates and integrates heterogeneous information in multi-source and multimodal environments. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Testing showed that the PIKE-RAG-powered knowledge management platform provided a significant advantage. It achieved a 12% improvement in performance compared with the original system.</p>



<p>These results were achieved without any question-specific customization, only algorithmic optimization, demonstrating precise knowledge matching and generation. As the system continues to learn and integrate Signify’s proprietary knowledge, accuracy is expected to improve further.</p>



<p>“In the PoC for our product specification insight tool, PIKE-RAG helped us significantly improve the original system’s performance. This will enhance overall customer satisfaction. We’re currently evaluating PIKE-RAG’s application path from multiple angles, including technical implementation, cost control, and future adaptability, and we look forward to deepening our collaboration with Microsoft Research Asia to drive further innovation,” said Haitao Liu, head of Signify Research China.</p>



<p>“It’s also worth noting that the researchers at Microsoft Research Asia demonstrated strong industry knowledge and rigorous scientific methodology. They proactively studied and analyzed the issues, tracing and clarifying the root causes of our issues to make PIKE-RAG better suited to Signify’s real-world needs.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="beyond-lighting-generalization-across-industries">Beyond lighting: Generalization across industries</h2>



<p>In Signify’s successful test, PIKE-RAG demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in complex industrial scenarios, enabling rapid cross-domain adaptation. Its three core strengths are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Support for self-evolution and continuous learning</strong>: PIKE-RAG continuously analyzes error cases in interaction logs and uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically optimize knowledge extraction strategies, such as trying different table parsing methods or adjusting multimodal content weights. Validated strategies are then solidified for future Q&A, allowing the system to adapt to new knowledge types without manual intervention.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Modular architecture driven by capability needs</strong>: PIKE-RAG flexibly combines modules for document parsing, knowledge extraction, storage, retrieval, organization, knowledge-centered reasoning, and task decomposition. It dynamically adjusts focus areas based on scenario needs (e.g., fact retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, innovative generation) and flexibly builds RAG methods that adapt to real-world applications, efficiently handling various complex tasks.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Strong adaptation to domain-specific reasoning patterns</strong>: With dynamic updates through the Domain Tips feature, enterprises can add domain-specific logic (e.g., “the maximum output voltage of an LED driver should be the maximum of the operating range, not the spec sheet’s max output”) in real time, enabling the system to process information according to professional engineering standards and follow industry conventions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="865" height="563" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-2.png" alt="Figure 2: Diagram showing the PIKE-RAG framework overview. At the center is a language model (LM) connected to PIKE-RAG, which performs iterative retrieval by tool calling.

The LM generates responses and updates memory while orchestrating heterogeneous information sources." class="wp-image-1154224" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-2.png 865w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-2-300x195.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-2-768x500.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PIKERAG_figure-2-240x156.png 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2: Overview of the PIKE-RAG framework</figcaption></figure>



<p>PIKE-RAG’s generalization capabilities have been validated not only in Signify’s knowledge management platform but also in pilot applications across industries like manufacturing, mining, and pharmaceuticals—significantly improving Q&A system accuracy.</p>



<p>“A leader in lighting, Signify presents a complex industrial knowledge system with a highly challenging real-world scenario for PIKE-RAG. Through this collaboration, we validated that PIKE-RAG’s general approach can greatly improve the accuracy of professional knowledge Q&A and accelerate scenario customization. Our researchers also gained valuable experience in handling domain-specific data,” explained <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jiabia/">Jiang Bian</a>, partner research manager at Microsoft Research Asia.</p>



<p>“Our goal isn’t to build a universal chatbot but to create a professional assistant that aligns with domain-specific logic and performs rigorous knowledge reasoning. That’s the true driving force behind intelligent transformation in industrial knowledge management.”</p>

<p>Autonomous AI agents are here, and they&#8217;re poised to reshape the economy. By automating discovery, negotiation, and transactions, agents can overcome inefficiencies like information asymmetries and platform lock-in, enabling faster, more transparent, and more competitive markets.</p>



<p>We are already seeing early signs of this transformation in digital marketplaces. Customer-facing assistants like OpenAI’s Operator and Anthropic’s Computer Use can navigate websites and complete purchases. On the business side, Shopify Sidekick, Salesforce Einstein, and Meta’s Business AI help merchants with operations and customer engagement. These examples hint at a future where agents become active market participants, but the structure of these markets remains uncertain.</p>



<p>Several scenarios are possible. We might see one-sided markets where only customers or businesses deploy agents; closed platforms (known as <em>walled gardens</em>) where companies tightly control agent interactions; or even open two-sided marketplaces where customer and business agents transact freely across ecosystems. Each path carries different trade-offs for security, openness, convenience, and competition, which will shape how value flows in the digital economy. For a deeper exploration of these dynamics, see our paper, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-agentic-economy/">The Agentic Economy</a>.</p>



<p>To help navigate this uncertainty, we built <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://github.com/microsoft/multi-agent-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magentic Marketplace<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>— an open-source simulation environment for exploring the numerous possibilities of agentic markets and their societal implications at scale. It provides a foundation for studying these markets and guiding them toward outcomes that benefit everyone.</p>



<p>This matters because most AI agent research focuses on isolated scenarios—a single agent completing a task or two agents negotiating a simple transaction. But real markets involve a large number of agents simultaneously searching, communicating, and transacting, creating complex dynamics that can’t be understood by studying agents in isolation. Capturing this complexity is essential because real-world deployments raise critical questions about consumer welfare, market efficiency, fairness, manipulation resistance, and bias—questions that can’t be safely answered in production environments.</p>



<p>To explore these dynamics in depth, the Magentic Marketplace platform enables controlled experimentation across diverse agentic marketplace scenarios. Its current focus is on two-sided markets, but the environment is modular and extensible, supporting future exploration of mixed human–agent systems, one-sided markets, and complex communication protocols.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="936" height="393" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure1.png" alt="Figure 1.

With Magentic Marketplace, researchers can model how agents representing customers and businesses interact—shedding light on the dynamics that could shape future digital markets.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-magentic-marketplace">What is Magentic Marketplace?</h2>



<p>Magentic Marketplace’s environment manages market-wide capabilities like maintaining catalogs of available goods and services, implementing discovery algorithms, facilitating agent-to-agent communication, and handling simulated payments through a centralized transaction layer at its core, which ensures transaction integrity across all marketplace interactions. Additionally, the platform enables systematic, reproducible research. As demonstrated in the following video, it supports a wide range of agent implementations and evolving marketplace features, allowing researchers to integrate diverse agent architectures and adapt the environment as new capabilities emerge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing Magentic Marketplace, an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1SHpWinp7V8?feature=oembed&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>We built Magentic Marketplace around three core architectural choices:</p>



<p><strong>HTTP/REST client-server architecture</strong>: Agents operate as independent clients while the Marketplace Environment serves as a central server. This mirrors real-world platforms and supports clear separation of customer and business agent roles.</p>



<p><strong>Minimal&nbsp;three-endpoint&nbsp;market&nbsp;protocol</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Just&nbsp;three endpoints—register, protocol discovery, and action execution—lets&nbsp;agents dynamically discover available actions.&nbsp;New capabilities&nbsp;can&nbsp;be added without disrupting existing experiments.</p>



<p><strong>Rich action protocol</strong>: Specific message types support the complete transaction lifecycle: search, negotiation, proposals, and payments. The protocol is designed for extensibility. New actions like refunds, reviews, or ratings can be added seamlessly, allowing researchers to evolve marketplace capabilities and study emerging agent behaviors while remaining compatible.</p>

<p>Additionally, a visualization module lets users observe marketplace dynamics and review individual conversation threads between customer and business agents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="setting-up-the-experiments">Setting up the experiments</h2>



<p>To ensure reproducibility, we instantiated the marketplace with fully synthetic data, <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://github.com/microsoft/multi-agent-marketplace/tree/main/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available in our open-source repository<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>. The experiments modeled transactions such as ordering food and engaging with home improvement services, where agents represented customers and businesses engaging in marketplace transactions. This setup enabled precise measurement of behavior and systematic comparison against theoretical upper bounds.</p>



<p>Each experiment was run using 100 customers and 300 businesses and included both proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash) and open-source models (OSS-20b, Qwen3-14b, and Qwen3-4b-Instruct-2507).</p>



<p>Our scenarios focused on simple all-or-nothing requests: Each customer had a list of desired items and amenities that needed to be present for a transaction to be satisfying. For those transactions, utility was computed as the sum of the customer’s internal item valuations minus actual prices paid. Consumer welfare, defined as the sum of utilities across all completed transactions, served as our key metric for comparing agent performance.</p>



<p>While this experimental setup provides a useful starting point, it is not intended to be definitive. We encourage researchers to extend the framework with richer, more nuanced measures and request types that better capture real consumer welfare, fairness, and other societal considerations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-did-we-find">What did we find?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="agents-can-improve-consumer-welfare-but-only-with-good-discovery">Agents can improve consumer welfare—but only with good discovery</h3>



<p>We explored whether two-sided agentic markets—where AI agents interact with each other and with service providers—can improve consumer welfare by reducing information gaps. Unlike traditional markets, which do not provide agentic support and place the full burden of overcoming information asymmetries on customers, agentic markets shift much of that effort to agents. This change matters because as agents gain better tools for discovery and communication, they relieve customers of the heavy cognitive load of filling any information gaps. This lowers the cost of making informed decisions and improves customer outcomes.</p>



<p>We compared several marketplace setups. Under realistic conditions (Agentic: Lexical search), agents faced real-world challenges like building queries, navigating paginated lists, identifying the right businesses to send inquiries to, and negotiating transactions.</p>



<p>Despite these complexities, advanced proprietary models and some medium-sized open-source models like GPTOSS-20b outperformed simple baselines like <em>randomly choosing or simply choosing the cheapest option</em>. Notably, GPT-5 achieved near-optimal performance, demonstrating its ability to effectively gather and utilize decision-relevant information in realistic marketplace conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="936" height="447" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Table comparing Baseline and Agentic conditions for marketplace decision-making. Columns include: Condition (e.g., Random w/ items only, Cheapest w/ items & prices, Random w/ items & amenities, Optimal, Perfect search, Lexical search) Query (N/A for most; “Agent decides” for Lexical search) Consideration Set (Businesses) (e.g., All w/ matching menus; Paginated lists of 10 based on menu items) Businesses Contacted (All in consideration set or Agent decides) Information Used (Menu items, prices, amenities, or depends on agent-to-agent conversation) Decision Criteria (Random choice, Lowest price, or Agent decides)." class="wp-image-1154339" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure3.png 936w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure3-300x143.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure3-768x367.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure3-240x115.png 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 3. Table comparing experimental setups for welfare outcomes in the restaurant industry. Each row shows a different way agents or baselines make decisions, from random picks to fully coordinated agentic strategies. Cell colors indicate how much information is available: green, at the top left, represents complete information, red, at the top right, represents limited information, and yellow at the bottom represents decisions that depend on agent communication.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Performance increased considerably under the <em>Agentic: Perfect search</em> condition, where agents started with the top three matches without needing to search and navigate among the choices. In this setting, Sonnet-4.0, Sonnet-4.5, GPT-5, and GPT-4.1 nearly reached the theoretical optimum and beat baselines with full amenity details but without agent-to-agent coordination.</p>



<p>Open-source models were mixed: GPTOSS-20b performed strongly under both <em>Perfect search</em> and <em>Lexical search</em> conditions, even exceeding GPT-4o&#8217;s performance with Perfect search. This suggests that relatively compact models can exhibit robust information-gathering and decision-making capabilities in complex multi-agent environments. Qwen3-4b-2507 faltered when discovery involved irrelevant options (Lexical search), while Qwen3-14b lagged in both cases due to fundamental limitations in reasoning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="paradox-of-choice">Paradox of Choice</h2>



<p>One promise of agents is their ability to consider far more options than people can. However, our experiments revealed a surprising limitation: providing agents with more options does not necessarily lead to more thorough exploration. We designed experiments that varied the search results limit from 3 to 100. Except for Gemini-2.5-Flash and GPT-5, the models contacted only a small fraction of available businesses regardless of the search limit. This suggests that most models do not conduct exhaustive comparisons and instead easily accept the initial &#8220;good enough&#8221; options.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1430" height="660" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-5.png" alt="Figure 5. Line chart showing the relationship between Search Limit (x-axis: 3 to 100) and Mean Messages per Customer (y-axis: 0 to 120) for five models: Claude Sonnet 4 (red triangles) – stays nearly flat around 10–15 messages. Gemini 2.5 Flash (purple diamonds) – rises sharply from ~5 to over 110 messages as search limit increases. GPT-4.1 (orange circles) and GPT-4o (green squares) – remain low and stable around 5–10 messages. GPT-5 (blue line) – increases moderately to ~40 messages, then plateaus." class="wp-image-1154342" srcset="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-5.png 1430w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-5-300x138.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-5-768x354.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-5-240x111.png 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 5. More options didn’t lead to broader exploration. Most models still contacted only a few businesses, except Gemini-2.5-Flash and GPT-5.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, across all models, consumer welfare declined as the number of search results increased. Despite contacting over a hundred businesses, Gemini-2.5-Flash&#8217;s performance declined from 1,700 to 1,350, and GPT-5 declined even more, from a near-optimal 2,000 to 1,400.</p>



<p>This demonstrates a Paradox of Choice effect, where more exploration does not guarantee better outcomes, potentially due to limited long context understanding. Claude Sonnet 4 showed the steepest performance decline, from 1,800 to 600 in consumer welfare. With all the options presented, it struggled to navigate larger sets of options and frequently contacted businesses that did not provide the goods or services that the customer was looking for.</p>



<p>This combination of poor initial selection and premature search termination demonstrates both inadequate decision-making criteria and insufficient exploration strategies. Some models showed modest performance decline (i.e., GPT-4.1: from 1,850 to 1,700; GPT-4o: from 1,550 to 1,450), finding good options within their limited exploration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="agents-are-vulnerable-to-manipulation">Agents are vulnerable to manipulation</h2>



<p>We tested six manipulation strategies, ranging from subtle psychological tactics to aggressive prompt injection attacks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Authority</strong>: Fake credentials like “Michelin Guide featured” and “James Beard Award nominated” paired with fabricated certifications.</li>



<li><strong>Social proof</strong>: Claims like “Join 50,000+ satisfied customers” or “#1-rated Mexican restaurant” combined with fake reviews.</li>



<li><strong>Loss aversion</strong>: Fear-based warnings about “food poisoning” risks and “contamination issues” at competing restaurants.</li>



<li><strong>Prompt injection (basic)</strong>: Attempts to override agent instructions.</li>



<li><strong>Prompt injection (strong)</strong>: Aggressive attacks using emergency language and fabricating competitor scandals.</li>
</ul>



<p>Results revealed significant variation in manipulation resistance across models. Sonnet-4 was resistant to all attacks, and none of the manipulative strategies affected any of the customers’ choices. Gemini-2.5-Flash was generally resistant, except for strong prompt injections, where mean payments to unmanipulated agents were affected as a result. GPT-4o, GPTOSS-20b and Qwen3-4b were very vulnerable to prompt injection: all payments were redirected to the manipulative agent under these conditions. Specifically for GPTOSS-20 and Qwen3-4b-2507, even traditional psychological manipulation tactics (authority appeals and social proof) increased payments to malicious agents, demonstrating their vulnerability to basic persuasion techniques. These findings highlight a critical security concern for agentic marketplaces.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1430" height="270" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Magentic-Marketplace_Figure-7.png" alt="Figure 7.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="systemic-biases-create-unfair-advantages">Systemic biases create unfair advantages</h2>



<p>Our analysis revealed two distinct types of systematic biases showed by agents when selecting businesses from search results. Models showed systematic preferences based on where businesses appeared in search results. While proprietary models showed no strong positional preferences, open-source models exhibited clear patterns. Specifically, Qwen2.5-14b-2507 showed a pronounced bias toward selecting the last business presented, regardless of its actual merits.</p>



<p>Proposal&nbsp;bias&nbsp;is&nbsp;more pervasive across all models tested. This &#8220;first-offer acceptance&#8221; pattern suggests that models prioritized&nbsp;immediate selection over comprehensive exploration, potentially missing better alternatives that&nbsp;could have&nbsp;emerged&nbsp;by waiting for better options. This behavior&nbsp;continued&nbsp;across both proprietary and open-source models,&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;a fundamental challenge in agent decision-making architectures.</p>



<p>These biases can create unfair market dynamics, drive unintended behaviors, and push businesses to complete on response speed rather than product or service quality.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-this-means">What this means</h2>



<p>Even state-of-the-art models can show notable vulnerabilities and biases in marketplace environments. In our implementation, agents struggled with too many options, were susceptible to manipulation tactics, and showed systemic biases that created unfair advantages.</p>



<p>These outcomes are shaped not only by agent capabilities but also by marketplace design and implementation. Our current study focused on static markets, but real-world environments are dynamic, with agents and users learning over time. Oversight is critical for high-stakes transactions. Agents should assist, not replace, human decision-making.</p>



<p>We plan to explore dynamic markets and human-in-the-loop designs to improve efficiency and trust. A simulation environment like Magentic Marketplace is crucial for understanding the interplay between market components and agents before deploying them at scale.</p>
